"  The coupling of laser light to matter can exert sub-cycle coherent control over material properties, with optically induced currents and magnetism shown to be controllable on ultrafast femtosecond time scales. Here, by employing laser light consisting of both linear and circular pulses, we show that charge of specified spin and crystal momentum can be created with precision throughout the first Brillouin zone. Our hybrid pulses induce in a controlled way both adiabatic intraband motion as well as vertical interband excitation between valence and conduction bands, and require only a gapped spin split valley structure for their implementation. This scenario is commonly found in the 2d semi-conductors, and we demonstrate our approach with monolayer WSe$_2$. We thus establish a route from laser light to local control over excitations in reciprocal space, opening the way to the preparation of momenta specified excited states at ultrafast time scales.

"  5G millimeter wave (mmWave) signals can be used to jointly localize the receiver and map the propagation environment in vehicular networks, which is a typical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Mapping the environment is challenging, due to measurements comprising both specular and diffuse multipath components, and diffuse multipath is usually considered as a perturbation. We here propose a novel method to utilize all available multipath signals from each landmark for mapping and incorporate this into a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture for the 5G SLAM problem. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We developed an experiment to study different aspects of granular matter under microgravity. The 1.5U small experiment was carried out on the International Space Station. About 3500 almost identical spherical glass particles with 856 um diameter were placed in a container of 50*50 mm cross section. Adjusting the height between 5 and 50 mm, the filling factor can be varied. The sample was vibrated under different frequencies and amplitudes. The majority of the data are video images of the particles motion. Here, we first give an overview of the general setup and a first qualitative account of different phenomena observed in about 700 experimental runs. These phenomena include collisional cooling, collective motion via gas-cluster coupling, and the influence of electrostatic forces on particle-particle interactions. ",astrophysics
"  We consider the most general set of integrable deformations extending the $T\bar{T}$ deformation of two-dimensional relativistic QFTs. They are CDD deformations of the theory's factorised S-matrix related to the higher-spin conserved charges. Using a mirror version of the generalised Gibbs ensemble, we write down the finite-volume expectation value of the higher-spin charges, and derive a generalised flow equation that every charge must obey under a generalised $T\bar{T}$ deformation. This also reproduces the known flow equations on the nose. ",high energy physics theory
"  X-ray photometry and optical spectra are presented covering the periastron passage of the highly-eccentric, ~50 year binary system PSR J2032+4127 in November 2017. This system consists of a 143 ms pulsar in orbit around a massive OB star, MT 91-213. The data show dramatic changes during the encounter as the pulsar wind collided with the stellar wind. The X-ray flux rose on the approach to periastron, then underwent a major dip in the few days around periastron, and then gradually declined over the next few weeks. The optical spectroscopy revealed a steady decline in the H? line strength on the approach to periastron (from an Equivalent Width of -15A to -7A) implying a truncation of the OB star's circumstellar disk by the approaching neutron star. Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) modelling is used here to model the system within the context of the observed behaviour and predict the geometrical configuration of the circumstellar disk with respect to the pulsar's orbit.

"  In this paper, we develop the theory of flag manifold over a semifield for any Kac-Moody root datum. We show that the flag manifold over a semifield admits a natural action of the monoid over that semifield associated with the Kac-Moody datum and admits a cellular decomposition. This extends the previous work of Lusztig, Postnikov, Rietsch and others on the totally nonnegative flag manifolds (of finite type) and the work of Lusztig, Speyer, Williams on the tropical flag manifolds (of finite type). As a by-product, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig on the duality of totally nonnegative flag manifold of finite type. ",mathematics
"  The North Polar Spur (NPS) is one of the largest structures observed in the Milky Way in both the radio and soft x-rays. While several predictions have been made regarding the origin of the NPS, modelling the structure is difficult without precise distance constraints. In this paper, we determine accurate distances to the southern terminus of the NPS and toward latitudes ranging up to 55$^{\circ}$. First, we fit for the distance and extinction to stars toward the NPS using optical and near-infrared photometry and Gaia DR2 astrometry. We model these per-star distance-extinction estimates as being caused by dust screens at unknown distances, which we fit for using a nested sampling algorithm. We then compare the extinction to the Spur derived from our 3D dust modelling with integrated independent measures from XMM-Newton X-ray absorption and HI column density measures. We find that we can account for nearly 100% of the total column density of the NPS as lying within 140 pc for latitudes $>26^{\circ}$ and within 700 pc for latitudes $< 11^{\circ}$. Based on the results, we conclude that the NPS is not associated with the Galactic Centre or the Fermi bubbles. Instead, it is likely associated, especially at higher latitudes, with the Sco-Cen association. ",astrophysics
"  Nearly all thermal radiation phenomena involving materials with linear response can be accurately described via semi-classical theories of light. Here, we go beyond these traditional paradigms to study a nonlinear system which, as we show, necessarily requires quantum theory of damping. Specifically, we analyze thermal radiation from a resonant system containing a $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear medium and supporting resonances at frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2\approx 2\omega_1$, where both resonators are driven only by intrinsic thermal fluctuations. Within our quantum formalism, we reveal new possibilities for shaping the thermal radiation. We show that the resonantly enhanced nonlinear interaction allows frequency-selective enhancement of thermal emission through upconversion, surpassing the well-known blackbody limits associated with linear media. Surprisingly, we also find that the emitted thermal light exhibits non-trivial statistics ($g^{(2)}(0) \neq 2$) and biphoton intensity correlations (at two distinct frequencies). We highlight that these features can be observed in the near future by heating a properly designed nonlinear system, without the need for any external signal. Our work motivates new interdisciplinary inquiries combining the fields of nonlinear photonics, quantum optics and thermal science. ",physics
"  Metasurfaces have attracted significant research interest owing to their unprecedented control over the spatial distributions of electromagnetic fields. Herein we propose the concept of metasurface tessellation to achieve reconfigurable scattering functions. Square meta-tiles, composed of identical structures, are arranged to fill a surface. The electromagnetic scattering of the tiled surface is determined by the orientation distribution of the meta-tiles. We present three typical cases of meta-tiles consisting of binary elements to realize several distinct scattering patterns. This study provides an alternative method to build reconfigurable and multi-functional metasurface devices without external stimuli and complicated fabrication. ",physics
"  In this work an iterative solution to build a network lifetime-preserving sampling strategy for WSNs is presented. The paper describes the necessary steps to reconstruct a graph from application data. Once the graph structure is obtained, a sampling strategy aimed at finding the smallest number of concurrent sensors needed to reconstruct the data in the unsampled nodes within a specific error bound, is presented. An iterative method then divides the sensor nodes into sets to be sampled sequentially to increase lifetime. Results on a real-life dataset show that the reconstruction RMSE can be easily traded off for a larger number of disjoint sampling sets which improve the network lifetime linearly.

"  Applications of deep learning to automatic multitrack mixing are largely unexplored. This is partly due to the limited available data, coupled with the fact that such data is relatively unstructured and variable. To address these challenges, we propose a domain-inspired model with a strong inductive bias for the mixing task. We achieve this with the application of pre-trained sub-networks and weight sharing, as well as with a sum/difference stereo loss function. The proposed model can be trained with a limited number of examples, is permutation invariant with respect to the input ordering, and places no limit on the number of input sources. Furthermore, it produces human-readable mixing parameters, allowing users to manually adjust or refine the generated mix. Results from a perceptual evaluation involving audio engineers indicate that our approach generates mixes that outperform baseline approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates the first approach in learning multitrack mixing conventions from real-world data at the waveform level, without knowledge of the underlying mixing parameters.

"  A local UV cutoff $\Lambda(x)$ transforming under Weyl rescalings allows to construct Weyl invariant kinetic terms for scalar fields including Wilsonian cutoff functions. First we consider scalar fields in curved space-time with local bare couplings of any canonical dimension, and anomalous dimensions which describe their dependence on the UV cutoff. The local component of the UV cutoff plays the role of an additional coupling, albeit with a trivial constant $\beta$ function. This approach allows to derive Weyl consistency conditions for the corresponding anomalous dimensions which assume the form of an exact gradient flow. For renormalizable theories the Weyl consistency conditions are initially of the form of an approximate gradient flow for the $\beta$ functions, and we derive conditions under which it becomes the form of an exact gradient flow.

  We present a template-free method of estimating pulse height of micro-calorimeter signals based on principal component analysis (PCA). The method is shown to improve the resolution on a simulated dataset by 25\% compared to the standard filtering technique that uses the averaged pulse as an estimation for the signal template. This technique is useful for reconstruction of pulses in micro-calorimeters with a high degree of pulse-shape variation where finding the correct signal templates is difficult. ,physics
"  We consider groups defined by non-empty balanced presentations with the property that each relator is of the form R(x,y), where x and y are distinct generators and R(.,.) is determined by some fixed cyclically reduced word R(a,b) that involves both a and b. To every such presentation we associate a directed graph whose vertices correspond to the generators and whose arcs correspond to the relators. Under the hypothesis that the girth of the underlying undirected graph is at least 4, we show that the resulting groups are non-trivial and cannot be finite of rank 3 or higher. Without the hypothesis on the girth it is well known that both the trivial group and finite groups of rank 3 can arise. ",mathematics
"  Prestellar cores are self-gravitating dense and cold structures within molecular clouds where future stars are born. They are expected, at the stage of transitioning to the protostellar phase, to harbor centrally concentrated dense (sub)structures that will seed the formation of a new star or the binary/multiple stellar systems. Characterizing this critical stage of evolution is key to our understanding of star formation. In this work, we report the detection of high density (sub)structures on the thousand-au scale in a sample of dense prestellar cores. Through our recent ALMA observations towards the Orion molecular cloud, we have found five extremely dense prestellar cores, which have centrally concentrated regions $\sim$ 2000 au in size, and several $10^7$ $cm^{-3}$ in average density. Masses of these centrally dense regions are in the range of 0.30 to 6.89 M$_\odot$. {\it For the first time}, our higher resolution observations (0.8$'' \sim $ 320 au) further reveal that one of the cores shows clear signatures of fragmentation; such individual substructures/fragments have sizes of 800 -1700 au, masses of 0.08 to 0.84 M$_\odot$, densities of $2 - 8\times 10^7$ $cm^{-3}$ and separations of $\sim 1200$ au. The substructures are massive enough ($\gtrsim 0.1~M_\odot$) to form young stellar objects and are likely examples of the earliest stage of stellar embryos which can lead to widely ($\sim$ 1200 au) separated multiple systems.

"  Tuning the near-field using all-dielectric nano-antennae offers a promising approach for trapping atoms, which could enable strong single-atom/photon coupling. Here we report the simulation results of an optical trapping concept, in which a silicon nano-antenna produces a trapping potential for atoms in a chip-scale configuration. Using counter-propagating incident fields, bichromatically detuned from the atomic cesium D-lines, we numerically investigate the dependence of the optical potential on the nano-antenna geometry. We tailor the near-field potential landscape by tuning the evanescent field of the waveguide using a toroidal nano-antenna, a configuration that enables trapping of ultracold Cs atoms. ",physics
"  Nontrivial topology in bulk matter has been linked with the existence of topologically protected interfacial states. We show that a gaseous plasmon polariton (GPP), an electromagnetic surface wave existing at the boundary of magnetized plasma and vacuum, has a topological origin that arises from the nontrivial topology of magnetized plasma. Because a gaseous plasma cannot sustain a sharp interface with discontinuous density, one must consider a gradual density falloff with scale length comparable or longer than the wavelength of the wave. We show that the GPP may be found within a gapped spectrum in present-day laboratory devices, suggesting that platforms are currently available for experimental investigation of topological wave physics in plasmas.

"  Let $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ be a fixed linear recurrence sequence of integers with order at least two, and for any positive integer $\ell$, let $\ell \cdot 2^{\ell} + 1$ be a Cullen number. Recently in \cite{bmt}, generalized Cullen numbers in terms of linear recurrence sequence $(U_n)_{n\geq 0}$ under certain weak assumptions has been studied. However, there is an error in their proof. In this paper, we generalize their work, as well as our result fixes their error. In particular, for a given polynomial $Q(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ we consider the Diophantine equation $U_{n_1} + \cdots + U_{n_k} = \ell \cdot x^{\ell} + Q(x)$, and prove effective finiteness result. Furthermore, we demonstrate our method by an example. ",mathematics
"  Efficient screening of chemicals is essential for exploring new materials. However, the search space is astronomically large, making calculations with conventional computers infeasible. For example, an $N$-component system of organic molecules generates >$10^{60N}$ candidates. Here, a quantum-inspired annealing machine is used to tackle the challenge of the large search space. The prototype system extracts candidate chemicals and their composites with desirable parameters, such as melting temperature and ionic conductivity. The system can be at least $10^4$-$10^7$ times faster than conventional approaches. Such exponential acceleration is critical for exploring the enormous search space in virtual screening. ",physics
"  de Sitter vacuum of nonconformal gauge theories is non-equilibrium, manifested by a nonvanishing rate of the comoving entropy production at asymptotically late times. This entropy production rate is related to the entanglement entropy of the de Sitter vacuum of the theory. We use holographic correspondence to compute vacuum entanglement entropy density $s_{ent}$ of mass deformed ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory - the ${\cal N}=2^*$ gauge theory - for various values of the masses and the coupling constant to the background space-time curvature. For a particular choice of the curvature coupling, the Euclidean model can be solved exactly using the supersymmetric localization. We show that ${\cal N}=2^*$ de Sitter entanglement entropy is not the thermodynamic entropy of the localization free energy at de Sitter temperature. Neither it is related to the thermal entropy of de Sitter vacuum of pair-produced particles. ",high energy physics theory
"  Using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and rescaled range (R/S) analysis, we investigate the scaling properties of EUV intensity fluctuations of low-latitude coronal holes (CHs) and neighboring quiet-Sun (QS) regions in signals obtained with the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) instrument. Contemporaneous line-of-sight SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetic fields provide a context for the physical environment. We find that the intensity fluctuations in the time series of EUV images present at each spatial point a scaling symmetry over the range $\sim 20$ min to $\sim$ 1 hour. Thus we are able to calculate a generalized Hurst exponent and produce image maps, not of physical quantities like intensity or temperature, but of a single dynamical parameter that sums up the statistical nature of the intensity fluctuations at each pixel. In quiet-Sun (QS) regions and in coronal holes (CHs) with magnetic bipoles, the scaling exponent ($1.0 < \alpha \leq 1.5$) corresponds to anti-correlated turbulent-like processes. In coronal holes, and in quiet-Sun regions primarily associated with (open) magnetic field of dominant polarity, the generalized exponent (0.5 $< \alpha <$ 1) corresponds to positively-correlated (persistent) processes. We identify a tendency for $\alpha$ $\sim$ $1$ near coronal hole boundaries and in other regions in which open and closed magnetic fields are in proximity. This is a signature of an underlying $1/f$ type process that is characteristic for self-organized criticality and shot-noise models. ",astrophysics
"  This investigation reports on the results of convolutional neural networks developed for the recently introduced PathologicAL Myopia (PALM) dataset, which consists of 1200 fundus images. We propose a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea. Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for pathological myopia classification, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images. Dice and F1 metrics for semantic segmentation of lesions scored 0.9303 and 0.9869 on optic disc, 0.8001 and 0.9135 on retinal atrophy, and 0.8073 and 0.7059 on retinal detachment, respectively. Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the ""PathologicAL Myopia detection from retinal images"" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019). Considering that (pathological) myopia cases are often identified as false positives and negatives in classification systems for glaucoma, we envision that the current work could aid in future research to discriminate between glaucomatous and highly-myopic eyes, complemented by the localization and segmentation of landmarks such as fovea, optic disc and atrophy.

"  Backstepping based controller and observer models were designed for higher order linear and nonlinear Schr\""odinger equations on a finite interval in Part I of this study where the controller was assumed to be acting from the left endpoint of the medium. In this companion paper, we further the analysis by considering boundary controller(s) acting at the right endpoint of the domain. It turns out that the problem is more challenging in this scenario as the associated boundary value problem for the backstepping kernel becomes overdetermined and lacks a smooth solution. The latter is essential to switch back and forth between the original plant and the so called target system. To overcome this difficulty we rely on the strategy of using an imperfect kernel, namely one of the boundary conditions in kernel PDE model is disregarded. The drawback is that one loses rapid stabilization in comparison with the left endpoint controllability. Nevertheless, the exponential decay of the $L^2$-norm with a certain rate still holds. The observer design is associated with new challenges from the point of view of wellposedness and one has to prove smoothing properties for an associated initial boundary value problem with inhomogeneous boundary data. This problem is solved by using Laplace transform in time. However, the Bromwich integral that inverts the transformed solution is associated with certain analyticity issues which are treated through a subtle analysis. Numerical algorithms and simulations verifying the theoretical results are given. ",mathematics
"  We investigate the possibility that the geometry dual to a typical AdS black hole microstate corresponds to the extended AdS-Schwarzschild geometry, including a region spacelike to the exterior. We argue that this region can be described by the mirror operators, a set of state-dependent operators in the dual CFT. We probe the geometry of a typical state by considering state-dependent deformations of the CFT Hamiltonian, which have an interpretation as a one-sided analogue of the Gao-Jafferis-Wall traversable wormhole protocol for typical states. We argue that the validity of the conjectured bulk geometry requires that out-of-time-order correlators of simple CFT operators on typical pure states must exhibit the same chaotic effects as thermal correlators at scrambling time. This condition is related to the question of whether the product of operators separated by scrambling time obey the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. We investigate some of these statements in the SYK model and discuss similarities with state-dependent perturbations of pure states in the SYK model previously considered by Kourkoulou and Maldacena. Finally, we discuss how the mirror operators can be used to implement an analogue of the Hayden-Preskill protocol. ",high energy physics theory
"  We propose a set of equations as a simple model for non singular evolutions of a $10 + 1$ dimensional M theory universe. Our model uses ideas from Loop Quantum Cosmology and offers a solution to the important problem of singularity resolutions. We solve the equations numerically and find that an M theory universe in this model evolves non singularly and with a bounce : going back in time, its density reaches a maximum and decreases thereafter whereas its physical size reaches a non vanishing minimum and increases thereafter. Taking the constituents of the universe to be the most entropic ones (which are four sets of intersecting M branes) leads to an effectively $3 + 1$ dimensional spacetime as the M theory universe expands, both in the infinite past and future.

In this article we describe a generalization of bit threads which allows us to describe max multiflows on hypergraphs. We further comment on its properties and interpretation in holography.

"  Tensor network operators, such as the matrix product operator (MPO) and the projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO), can provide efficient representation of certain linear operators in high dimensional spaces. This paper focuses on the efficient representation of tensor network operators with long-range pairwise interactions such as the Coulomb interaction. For MPOs, we find that all existing efficient methods exploit a peculiar ""upper-triangular low-rank"" (UTLR) property, i.e. the upper-triangular part of the matrix can be well approximated by a low-rank matrix, while the matrix itself can be full-rank. This allows us to convert the problem of finding the efficient MPO representation into a matrix completion problem. We develop a modified incremental singular value decomposition method (ISVD) to solve this ill-conditioned matrix completion problem. This algorithm yields equivalent MPO representation to that developed in [Stoudenmire and White, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2017]. In order to efficiently treat more general tensor network operators, we develop another strategy for compressing tensor network operators based on hierarchical low-rank matrix formats, such as the hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) format, and the $\mathcal{H}$-matrix format. Though the pre-constant in the complexity is larger, the advantage of using the hierarchical low-rank matrix format is that it is applicable to both MPOs and PEPOs. For the Coulomb interaction, the operator can be represented by a linear combination of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)\log(N/\epsilon))$ MPOs/PEPOs, each with a constant bond dimension, where $N$ is the system size and $\epsilon$ is the accuracy of the low-rank truncation. Neither the modified ISVD nor the hierarchical low-rank algorithm assumes that the long-range interaction takes a translation-invariant form. ",physics

Finally, we show that the construction of these toposes can be made (2-)functorial by considering geometric morphisms induced by continuous semigroup homomorphisms. ",mathematics
"  Neutral uranium (U I) is a very difficult atom for theoretical calculations due to a large number of valence electrons, six, strong valence-valence and valence-core correlations, high density of states, and relativistic effects. Configuration-interaction many-body perturbation theory (CI-MBPT) can treat efficiently valence-core correlations and relativistic effects, but because the formalism was developed for Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) starting potential that does not contain valence electrons, quite large CI space is needed to compensate for +6 charge of such a potential. Much more efficient is relativistic configuration-interaction (RCI) approach which uses relatively accurate starting DHF potential that includes some valence electrons to make the valence electron Hamiltonian diagonally dominated for some states. Here we report calculations of U I hyperfine constants of several low-energy states using the RCI method with the starting potential that includes four f valence electrons. With this starting potential, it is possible to use the single-configuration approximation or small basis sets to obtain quite accurate results for hyperfine structure constants. In fact, by scaling nuclear magnetic moment, the agreement for 5 levels was within 5\%, and a new magnetic moment can be recommended 0.43(2). The method can be further developed to include more extensive data sets to improve accuracy and can be applied to other atoms and for calculations of other properties, for example, relevant to fundamental symmetry tests.

"  Coherent steering of a quantum state, induced by a sequence of weak measurements, has become an active area of theoretical and experimental study. For a closed steered trajectory, the underlying phase factors involve both geometrical and dynamical terms. Furthermore, considering the reversal of the order of the measurement sequence, such a phase comprises a symmetric and an antisymmetric term. Superseding common wisdom, we show that the symmetric and the antisymmetric components do not correspond to the dynamical and geometrical parts respectively. Addressing a broad class of measurement protocols, we further investigate the dependence of the induced phases on the measurement parameters (e.g., the measurement strength). We find transitions between different topologically distinct sectors, defined by integer-valued winding numbers, and show that the transitions are accompanied by diverging dephasing. We propose experimental protocols to observe these effects. ",quantum physics
"  We report on NICER observations of the Magnetar SGR~1935+2154, covering its 2020 burst storm and long-term persistent emission evolution up to $\sim90$ days post outburst. During the first 1120~seconds taken on April 28 00:40:58 UTC we detect over 217 bursts, corresponding to a burst rate of $>0.2$ bursts s$^{-1}$. Three hours later the rate is at 0.008 bursts s$^{-1}$, remaining at a comparatively low level thereafter. The $T_{90}$ burst duration distribution peaks at 840~ms; the distribution of waiting times to the next burst is fit with a log-normal with an average of 2.1 s. The 1-10 keV burst spectra are well fit by a blackbody, with an average temperature and area of $kT=1.7$ keV and $R^2=53$ km$^2$. The differential burst fluence distribution over $\sim3$ orders of magnitude is well modeled with a power-law form $dN/dF\propto F^{-1.5\pm0.1}$. The source persistent emission pulse profile is double-peaked hours after the burst storm. We find that the bursts peak arrival times follow a uniform distribution in pulse phase, though the fast radio burst associated with the source aligns in phase with the brighter peak. We measure the source spin-down from heavy-cadence observations covering days 21 to 39 post-outburst, $\dot\nu=-3.72(3)\times10^{-12}$ Hz s$^{-1}$; a factor 2.7 larger than the value measured after the 2014 outburst. Finally, the persistent emission flux and blackbody temperature decrease rapidly in the early stages of the outburst, reaching quiescence 40 days later, while the size of the emitting area remains unchanged.

"  Aims. Formamide (HCONH2) is the simplest molecule containing the peptide bond first detected in the gas phase in Orion-KL and SgrB2. In recent years, it has been observed in high temperature regions such as hot corinos, where thermal desorption is responsible for the sublimation of frozen mantles into the gas phase. The interpretation of observations can benefit from information gathered in the laboratory, where it is possible to simulate the thermal desorption process and to study formamide under simulated space conditions such as UV irradiation. Methods. Here, two laboratory analyses are reported: we studied formamide photo-stability under UV irradiation when it is adsorbed by space relevant minerals at 63 K and in the vacuum regime. We also investigated temperature programmed desorption of pure formamide ice in the presence of TiO2 dust before and after UV irradiation. Results. Through these analyses, the effects of UV degradation and the interaction between formamide and different minerals are compared.We find that silicates, both hydrates and anhydrates, offer molecules a higher level of protection from UV degradation than mineral oxides. The desorption temperature found for pure formamide is 220 K. The desorption temperature increases to 250 K when the formamide desorbs from the surface of TiO2 grains. Conclusions. Through the experiments outlined here, it is possible to follow the desorption of formamide and its fragments, simulate the desorption process in star forming regions and hot corinos, and constrain parameters such as the thermal desorption temperature of formamide and its fragments and the binding energies involved. Our results offer support to observational data and improve our understanding of the role of the grain surface in enriching the chemistry in space. ",astrophysics
"  VC-dimension and VC-density are measures of combinatorial complexity of set systems. VC-dimension was first introduced in the context of statistical learning theory, and is tightly related to the sample complexity in PAC learning. VC-density is a refinement of VC-dimension. Both notions are also studied in model theory, in the context of \emph{dependent} theories. A set system that is definable by a formula of first-order logic with parameters has finite VC-dimension if and only if the formula is a dependent formula.   In this paper we study the VC-dimension and the VC-density of the edge relation $Exy$ on Johnson graphs and on Hamming graphs. On a graph $G$, the set system defined by the formula $Exy$ is the vertex set of $G$ along with the collection of all \emph{open neighbourhoods} of $G$.   We show that the edge relation has VC-dimension at most $4$ on Johnson graphs and at most $3$ on Hamming graphs and these bounds are optimal.   We furthermore show that the VC-density of the edge relation on the class of all Johnson graphs is $2$, and on the class of all Hamming graphs the VC-density is $2$ as well. Moreover, we show that our bounds on the VC-dimension carry over to the class of all induced subgraphs of Johnson graphs, and to the class of all induced subgraphs of Hamming graphs, respectively. It also follows that the VC-dimension of the set systems of \emph{closed neighbourhoods} in Johnson graphs and Hamming graphs is bounded.   Johnson graphs and Hamming graphs are well known examples of distance transitive graphs.   Neither of these graph classes is nowhere dense nor is there a bound on their (local) clique-width.   Our results contrast this by giving evidence of structural tameness of the graph classes. ",mathematics

As in the standard electric formulation, Lorentz invariance requires the addition of additional boundary degrees of freedom at infinity, found here to be of both electric and magnetic types. A notable feature of this duality symmetric formulation, which we comment upon, is that the on-shell values of the zero modes of the gauge generators are equal to only half of the electric and magnetic fluxes (the other half is brought in by Dirac-string type contributions). Another notable feature is the absence of central extension in the angle-dependent $u(1)^2$-algebra. ",high energy physics theory
"  The global climate crisis poses new risks to humanity, and with them, new challenges to the practices of professional astronomy. Avoiding the more catastrophic consequences of global warming by more than 1.5 degrees requires an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the 2018 United Nations Intergovernmental Panel report, this will necessitate a 45% reduction of emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Efforts are required at all levels, from the individual to the governmental, and every discipline must find ways to achieve these goals. This will be especially difficult for astronomy with its significant reliance on conference and research travel, among other impacts. However, our long-range planning exercises provide the means to coordinate our response on a variety of levels.

"  Motivated by the BPS/CFT correspondence, we explore the similarities between the classical $\beta$-deformed Hermitean matrix model and the $q$-deformed matrix models associated to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories on $D^2\times_{q}S^1$ and $S_b^3$ by matching parameters of the theories. The novel results that we obtain are the correlators for the models, together with an additional result in the classical case consisting of the $W$-algebra representation of the generating function. Furthermore, we also obtain surprisingly simple expressions for the expectation values of characters which generalize previously known results. ",high energy physics theory
"  Leading- and trailing-edge serrations have been widely used to reduce the leading- and trailing-edge noise in applications such as contra-rotating fans and large wind turbines. Recent studies show that these two noise problems can be modelled analytically using the Wiener-Hopf method. However, the resulting models involve infinite-interval integrals that cannot be evaluated analytically, and consequently implementing them poses practical difficulty. This paper develops easily-implementable noise prediction models for flat plates with serrated leading and trailing edges, respectively. By exploiting the fact that high-order modes are cut-off and adjacent modes do not interfere in the far field except at sufficiently high frequencies, an infinite-interval integral involving two infinite sums is approximated by a single straightforward sum. Numerical comparison shows that the resulting models serve as excellent approximations to the original models. Good agreement is also achieved when the leading-edge model predictions are compared with experimental results for sawtooth serrations of various root-to-tip amplitudes. Importantly, the models developed in this paper can be evaluated robustly in a very efficient manner. For example, a typical far-field noise spectrum can be calculated within milliseconds for both the trailing- and leading-edge noise models on a standard desktop computer. Due to their efficiency and ease of numerical implementation, these models are expected to be of particular importance in applications where a numerical optimization is likely to be needed. ",physics
"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) show a significant impact on medical imaging. One significant problem with adopting DNNs for skin cancer classification is that the class frequencies in the existing datasets are imbalanced. This problem hinders the training of robust and well-generalizing models. Data Augmentation addresses this by using existing data more effectively. However, standard data augmentation implementations are manually designed and produce only limited reasonably alternative data. Instead, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is utilized to generate a much broader set of augmentations. This paper proposes a novel enhancement for the progressive generative adversarial networks (PGAN) using self-attention mechanism. Self-attention mechanism is used to directly model the long-range dependencies in the feature maps. Accordingly, self-attention complements PGAN to generate fine-grained samples that comprise clinically-meaningful information. Moreover, the stabilization technique was applied to the enhanced generative model. To train the generative models, ISIC 2018 skin lesion challenge dataset was used to synthesize highly realistic skin lesion samples for boosting further the classification result. We achieve an accuracy of 70.1% which is 2.8% better than the non-augmented one of 67.3%. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  The ROC curve is the gold standard for measuring the performance of a test/scoring statistic regarding its capacity to discriminate between two statistical populations in a wide variety of applications, ranging from anomaly detection in signal processing to information retrieval, through medical diagnosis. Most practical performance measures used in scoring/ranking applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be viewed as summaries of the ROC curve. In this paper, the fact that most of these empirical criteria can be expressed as two-sample linear rank statistics is highlighted and concentration inequalities for collections of such random variables, referred to as two-sample rank processes here, are proved, when indexed by VC classes of scoring functions. Based on these nonasymptotic bounds, the generalization capacity of empirical maximizers of a wide class of ranking performance criteria is next investigated from a theoretical perspective. It is also supported by empirical evidence through convincing numerical experiments. ",mathematics
"  Quantum state preparation is an important class of quantum algorithms that is employed as a black-box subroutine in many algorithms, or used by itself to generate arbitrary probability distributions. We present a novel state preparation method that utilizes less quantum computing resource than the existing methods. Two variants of the algorithm with different emphases are introduced. One variant uses fewer qubits and no controlled gates, while the other variant potentially requires fewer gates overall. A general analysis is given to estimate the number of qubits necessary to achieve a desired precision in the amplitudes of the computational basis states. The validity of the algorithm is demonstrated using a prototypical problem of generating Ising model spin configurations according to its Boltzmann distribution. ",quantum physics
"  We use the notion of double holography to study Hawking radiation emitted by the eternal BTZ black hole in equilibrium with a thermal bath, but in the form of warped CFT$_2$ degrees of freedom. In agreement with the literature, we find entanglement islands and a phase transition in the entanglement surface, but our results differ significantly from work in AdS/CFT in three major ways: (1) the late-time entropy decreases in time, (2) island degrees of freedom exist at all times, and not just at late times, with the phase transition changing whether or not these degrees of freedom include the black hole interior, and (3) the physics involves a field-theoretic IR divergence, emerging when the boundary interval is too big relative to the black hole's inverse temperature. This behavior in the entropy appears to be consistent with the non-unitarity of holographic warped CFT$_2$ and demonstrates that the islands are not a phenomenon restricted to black hole information in unitary setups.

"  Software for mixed-integer linear programming can return incorrect results for a number of reasons, one being the use of inexact floating-point arithmetic. Even solvers that employ exact arithmetic may suffer from programming or algorithmic errors, motivating the desire for a way to produce independently verifiable certificates of claimed results. Due to the complex nature of state-of-the-art MILP solution algorithms, the ideal form of such a certificate is not entirely clear. This paper proposes such a certificate format, illustrating its capabilities and structure through examples. The certificate format is designed with simplicity in mind and is composed of a list of statements that can be sequentially verified using a limited number of simple yet powerful inference rules. We present a supplementary verification tool for compressing and checking these certificates independently of how they were created. We report computational results on a selection of mixed-integer linear programming instances from the literature. To this end, we have extended the exact rational version of the MIP solver SCIP to produce such certificates. ",mathematics
"  This paper is concerned with the design of a non-intrusive model order reduction (MOR) for the system of parametric time-domain Maxwell equations. A time- and parameter-independent reduced basis (RB) is constructed by using a two-step proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique from a collection of full-order electromagnetic field solutions, which are generated via a discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) solver. The mapping between the time/parameter values and the projection coefficients onto the RB space is approximated by a Gaussian process regression (GPR). Based on the data characteristics of electromagnetic field solutions, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to extract the principal components of the training data of each projection coefficient, and the GPR models are trained for time- and parameter-modes respectively, by which the final global regression function can be represented as a linear combination of these time- and parameter-Gaussian processes. The extraction of the RB and the training of GPR surrogate models are both completed in the offline stage. Then the field solution at any new input time/parameter point can be directly recovered in the online stage as a linear combination of the RB with the regression outputs as the coefficients. In virtue of its non-intrusive nature, the proposed POD-GPR framework, which is equation-free, decouples the offline and online stages completely, and hence can predict the electromagnetic solution fields at unseen parameter locations quickly and effectively. The performance of our method is illustrated by a scattering problem of a multi-layer dielectric cylinder. ",mathematics
"  Digital cameras can only capture a limited range of real-world scenes' luminance, producing images with saturated pixels. Existing single image high dynamic range (HDR) reconstruction methods attempt to expand the range of luminance, but are not able to hallucinate plausible textures, producing results with artifacts in the saturated areas. In this paper, we present a novel learning-based approach to reconstruct an HDR image by recovering the saturated pixels of an input LDR image in a visually pleasing way. Previous deep learning-based methods apply the same convolutional filters on well-exposed and saturated pixels, creating ambiguity during training and leading to checkerboard and halo artifacts. To overcome this problem, we propose a feature masking mechanism that reduces the contribution of the features from the saturated areas. Moreover, we adapt the VGG-based perceptual loss function to our application to be able to synthesize visually pleasing textures. Since the number of HDR images for training is limited, we propose to train our system in two stages. Specifically, we first train our system on a large number of images for image inpainting task and then fine-tune it on HDR reconstruction. Since most of the HDR examples contain smooth regions that are simple to reconstruct, we propose a sampling strategy to select challenging training patches during the HDR fine-tuning stage. We demonstrate through experimental results that our approach can reconstruct visually pleasing HDR results, better than the current state of the art on a wide range of scenes.

"  Identifying galaxy groups from redshift surveys of galaxies plays an important role in connecting galaxies with the underlying dark matter distribution. Current and future high-$z$ spectroscopic surveys, usually incomplete in redshift sampling, present both opportunities and challenges to identifying groups in the high-$z$ Universe.

Test using realistic mock catalogs shows that $\gtrsim 90\%$ of true groups with halo masses $\rm M_h \gtrsim 10^{12} M_{\odot}/h$ are successfully identified, and that the fraction of contaminants is smaller than $10\%$. The standard deviation in the halo mass estimation is smaller than 0.25 dex at all masses. We apply our group finder to zCOSMOS-bright and describe basic properties of the group catalog obtained.

"  We present a formula for the quantum entropy of supersymmetric five-dimensional spinning black holes in M-theory compactified on $CY_3$, i.e., BMPV black holes. We use supersymmetric localization in the framework of off-shell five dimensional $N=2$ supergravity coupled to $I = 1,\dots,N_V + 1$ off-shell vector multiplets. The theory is governed at two-derivative level by the symmetric tensor $\mathcal{C}_{IJK}$ (the intersection numbers of the Calabi-Yau) and at four-derivative level by the gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons coupling $c_I$ (the second Chern class of the Calabi-Yau). The quantum entropy is an $N_V + 2$-dimensional integral parameterised by one real parameter $\varphi^I$ for each vector multiplet and an additional parameter $\varphi^0$ for the gravity multiplet. The integrand consists of an action governed completely by $\mathcal{C}_{IJK}$ and $c_{I}$, and a one-loop determinant. Consistency with the on-shell logarithmic corrections to the entropy, the symmetries of the very special geometry of the moduli space, and an assumption of analyticity constrains the one-loop determinant up to a scale-independent function $f(\varphi^0)$. For $f=1$ our result agrees completely with the topological M-theory conjecture of Dijkgraaf, Gukov, Nietzke, and Vafa for static black holes at two derivative level, and provides a natural extension to higher derivative corrections. For rotating BMPV black holes, our result differs from the DGNV conjecture at the level of the first quantum corrections. ",high energy physics theory
"  Taking advantage of HST CANDELS data, we analyze the lowest redshift (z<0.5) massive galaxies in order to disentangle their structural constituents and study possible faint non-axis-symmetric features. Due to the excellent HST spatial resolution for intermediate-z objects, they are hard to model by purely automatic parametric fitting algorithms. We performed careful single and double S\'ersic fits to their galaxy surface brightness profiles. We also compare the model color profiles with the observed ones and also derive multi-component global effective radii attempting to obtain a better interpretation of the mass-size relation. Additionally, we test the robustness of our measured structural parameters via simulations. We find that the S\'ersic index does not offer a good proxy for the visual morphological type for our sample of massive galaxies. Our derived multi-component effective radii give a better description of the size of our sample galaxies than those inferred from single S\'ersic models with GALFIT. Our galaxy population lays on the scatter of the local mass-size relation, indicating that these massive galaxies do not experience a significant growth in size since z~0.5. Interestingly the few outliers are late-type galaxies, indicating that spheroids must reach the local mass-size relation earlier. For most of our sample galaxies, both single and multi-component S\'ersic models with GALFIT show substantial systematic deviations from the observed SBPs in the outskirts. These residuals may be partly due to several factors, namely a non-optimal data reduction for low surface brightness features, the existence of prominent stellar haloes for massive galaxies and could also arise from conceptual shortcomings of parametric 2D image decomposition tools. They consequently propagate into galaxy color profiles. ",astrophysics
"  Background: Depression has become a major health burden worldwide, and effective detection depression is a great public-health challenge. This Electroencephalography (EEG)-based research is to explore the effective biomarkers for depression recognition. Methods: Resting state EEG data was collected from 24 major depressive patients (MDD) and 29 normal controls using 128 channel HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net (HCGSN). To better identify depression, we extracted different types of EEG features including linear features, nonlinear features and functional connectivity features phase lagging index (PLI) to comprehensively analyze the EEG signals in patients with MDD. And using different feature selection methods and classifiers to evaluate the optimal feature sets. Results: Functional connectivity feature PLI is superior to the linear features and nonlinear features. And when combining all the types of features to classify MDD patients, we can obtain the highest classification accuracy 82.31% using ReliefF feature selection method and logistic regression (LR) classifier. Analyzing the distribution of optimal feature set, it was found that intrahemispheric connection edges of PLI were much more than the interhemispheric connection edges, and the intrahemispheric connection edges had a significant differences between two groups. Conclusion: Functional connectivity feature PLI plays an important role in depression recognition. Especially, intrahemispheric connection edges of PLI might be an effective biomarker to identify depression. And statistic results suggested that MDD patients might exist functional dysfunction in left hemisphere. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We present a family of topological quantum gravity theories associated with the geometric theory of the Ricci flow on Riemannian manifolds. First we use BRST quantization to construct a ""primitive"" topological Lifshitz-type theory for only the spatial metric, with spatial diffeomorphism invariance and no gauge symmetry, associated with Hamilton's Ricci flow: Hamilton's flow equation appears as the localization equation of the primitive theory. Then we extend the primitive theory by gauging foliation-preserving spacetime symmetries. Crucially, all our theories are required to exhibit an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. First, we gauge spatial diffeomorphisms, and show that this gives us access to the mathematical technique known as the DeTurck trick. Finally, we gauge foliation-preserving time reparametrizations, both with the projectable and nonprojectable lapse function. The path integral of the full theory is localized to the solutions of Ricci-type flow equations, generalizing those of Perelman. The role of Perelman's dilaton is played by the nonprojectable lapse function. Perelman's ${\cal F}$-functional appears as the superpotential of our theory. Since there is no spin-statistics theorem in nonrelativistic quantum field theory, the two supercharges of our gravity theory do not have to be interpreted as BRST charges and, after the continuation to real time, the theory can be studied as a candidate for nonrelativistic quantum gravity with propagating bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom.

"  Context. Stellar internal magnetic fields have recently been shown to leave a detectable signature on period spacing patterns of gravity modes.   Aims. We investigate the effect of the obliquity of a mixed (poloidal and toroidal) dipolar internal fossil magnetic field with respect to the rotation axis on the frequency of gravity modes in rapidly rotating stars.   Methods. We use the traditional approximation of rotation to compute non-magnetic modes, and a perturbative treatment of the magnetic field to compute the corresponding frequency shifts. We apply the new formalism to HD 43317, a magnetic, rapidly rotating, slowly pulsating B-type star, whose field has an obliquity angle of about 80{\deg}.   Results. We find that frequency shifts induced by the magnetic field on high-radial-order gravity modes are larger with increasing obliquity angle, when the magnetic axis is closer to the equatorial region, where these modes are trapped. The maximum value is reached for an obliquity angle of 90{\deg}. This trend is observed for all mode geometries.   Conclusions. Our results predict that the signature of an internal oblique dipolar magnetic field is detectable using asteroseismology of gravity modes. ",astrophysics
"  Within the framework of the AdS/CMT correspondence asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes in four space-time dimensions can be used to analyse transport properties in two space dimensions.

The ${\cal Q}$-factor of the cyclotron resonance is shown to decrease as the temperature is increased and increase as the charge density is increased in a fixed magnetic field. Likewise the dissipative Ohmic conductivity at resonance increases as the temperature is decreased and as the charge density is increased. The analysis also involves a discussion of the piezoelectric effect in the context of the AdS/CMT framework. ",high energy physics theory
"  Interferometric measurements with arrays of radio antennas are a powerful and widely used technique in astronomy. Recently, this technique has been revisited for the reconstruction of extensive air showers [1]. This radio-interferometric technique exploits the coherence in the radio emission emitted by billions of secondary shower particles to reconstruct the shower parameters, in particular the shower axis and depth of the shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$. The accuracy previously demonstrated on simulations with an idealized detector is very promising. In this article we evaluate the potential of interferometric $X_\mathrm{max}$ measurements using (simulated) inclined air showers with sparse antenna arrays under realistic conditions. To determine prerequisites for the application of the radio-interferometric technique with various antenna arrays, the influence of inaccuracies in the time synchronisation between antennas and its inter-dependency with the antenna density is investigated in detail. We find a strong correlation between the antenna multiplicity (per event) and the maximum acceptable time jitter, i.e., inaccuracy in the time synchronisation. For data recorded with a time synchronisation accurate to within 1 ns in the commonly used frequency band of 30 to 80 MHz, an antenna multiplicity of $> 50$ is needed to achieve an $X_\mathrm{max}$ resolution of $\sigma_{X_\mathrm{max}} \lesssim 20$ g cm$^{-2}$. For data recorded with 2 ns accuracy, already $\gtrsim 200$ antennas are needed to achieve this $X_\mathrm{max}$ resolution. Furthermore, we find no advantage reconstructing $X_\mathrm{max}$ from data simulated at higher observation frequencies, i.e., up to several hundred MHz. Finally, we provide a generalisation of our results from very inclined air showers to vertical geometries. ",astrophysics

Our re-distribution construction can be considered as a generalization of a method applied by Ursell in his construction of a counter-example to a conjecture by Nevanlinna.

"  The massive two-dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with isospin (isoNJL) is reconsidered in the large $N_c$ limit. We continue the exploration of its phase diagram by constructing missing first-order phase boundaries. At zero temperature, a phase boundary in the plane of baryon and isospin chemical potentials separates the vacuum from a crystal phase. We derive it from the baryon spectrum of the isoNJL model which, in turn, is obtained via a numerical Hartree-Fock (HF) calculation. At finite temperature, a first-order phase boundary sheet is found using a thermal HF calculation. It interpolates smoothly between the zero temperature phase boundary and the perturbative sheet. The calculations remain tractable owing to the assumption that the charged pion condensate vanishes. In that case, most of the calculations can be done with methods developed in the past for solving the massive one-flavor NJL model. ",high energy physics theory

By analytically continuing to Lorentzian signature we show that the spectral density at high spatial momenta has support on the spectrum condition $|\omega| > |k|$. This leads to a series of sum rules. Finally, we explicitly match the thermal block expansion with the momentum space Green's function at finite temperature in several examples.

"  Regarding the significant interests in massive gravity and combining it with gravity's rainbow and also BTZ black holes, we apply the formalism introduced by Jiang and Han in order to investigate the quantization of the entropy of black holes. We show that the entropy of BTZ black holes in massive gravity's rainbow is quantized with equally spaced spectra and it depends on the black holes' properties including massive parameters, electrical charge, the cosmological constant and also rainbow functions. In addition, we show that quantization of the entropy results into the appearance of novel properties for this quantity such as; the existence of divergencies, non-zero entropy in vanishing horizon radius and possibility of tracing out the effects of black holes' properties. Such properties are absent in the non-quantized version of these black holes' entropy. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of quantization on the thermodynamical behavior of the solutions. We confirm that due to quantization, novel phase transitions points are introduced and stable solutions are limited to only dS black holes (AdS and asymptotically flat solutions are unstable).

"  When energy customers schedule loads ahead of time, this information, if acquired by their energy retailer, can improve the retailer's load forecasts. Better forecasts lead to wholesale purchase decisions that are likely to result in lower energy imbalance costs, and thus higher profits for the retailer. Therefore, this paper monetizes the value of the customer schedulable load data by quantifying the retailer's profit gain from adjusting the wholesale purchase based on such data. Using a cooperative game theoretic approach, the retailer translates their increased profit in expectation into the value of cooperation, and redistributes a portion of it among the customers as monetary incentives for them to continue providing their load data. Through case studies, this paper demonstrates the significance of the additional profit for the retailer from using the proposed framework, and evaluates the long-term monetary benefits to the customers based on different payoff allocation methods.

"  We investigate a model of interacting Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions with $M$ flavors and $N$ colors having the $\mathrm{U}(M)\times \mathrm{SU}(N)$ symmetry. In the large-$N$ limit, we find that the $\mathrm{U}(M)$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in a variety of ways. In the vacuum, when the parity-breaking flavor-singlet mass is varied, the ground state undergoes a sequence of $M$ first-order phase transitions, experiencing $M+1$ phases characterized by symmetry breaking $\mathrm{U}(M)\to \mathrm{U}(M-k)\times \mathrm{U}(k)$ with $k\in\{0,1,2,\cdots,M\}$, bearing a close resemblance to the vacuum structure of three-dimensional QCD.

One of the clear physical manifestations of topological phase is the bulk-boundary correspondence, the existence of localized unidirectional modes at the interface between topologically distinct phases. These concepts are illustrated through examples, including the simple magnetized cold plasma. An outlook is provided for future theoretical developments and possible applications. ",physics
"  We study the Regge limit of 4-point AdS$_3 \times S^3$ correlators in the tree-level supergravity approximation and provide various explicit checks of the relation between the eikonal phase derived in the bulk picture and the anomalous dimensions of certain double-trace operators. We consider both correlators involving all light operators and HHLL correlators with two light and two heavy multi-particle states. These heavy operators have a conformal dimension proportional to the central charge and are pure states of the theory, dual to asymptotically AdS$_3 \times S^3$ regular geometries. Deviation from AdS$_3 \times S^3$ is parametrised by a scale $\mu$ and is related to the conformal dimension of the dual heavy operator. In the HHLL case, we work at leading order in $\mu$ and derive the CFT data relevant to the bootstrap relations in the Regge limit. Specifically, we show that the minimal solution to these equations relevant for the conical defect geometries is different to the solution implied by the microstate geometries dual to pure states.

"  Multi-parameter cognition in a cognitive radio network (CRN) provides a more thorough understanding of the radio environments, and could potentially lead to far more intelligent and efficient spectrum usage for a secondary user. In this paper, we investigate the multi-parameter cognition problem for a CRN where the primary transmitter (PT) radiates multiple transmit power levels, and propose a learning-based two-stage spectrum sharing strategy. We first propose a data-driven/machine learning based multi-level spectrum sensing scheme, including the spectrum learning (Stage I) and prediction (the first part in Stage II). This fully blind sensing scheme does not require any prior knowledge of the PT power characteristics. Then, based on a novel normalized power level alignment metric, we propose two prediction-transmission structures, namely periodic and non-periodic, for spectrum access (the second part in Stage II), which enable the secondary transmitter (ST) to closely follow the PT power level variation. The periodic structure features a fixed prediction interval, while the non-periodic one dynamically determines the interval with a proposed reinforcement learning algorithm to further improve the alignment metric. Finally, we extend the prediction-transmission structure to an online scenario, where the number of PT power levels might change as a consequence of PT adapting to the environment fluctuation or quality of service variation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in various scenarios. ",electrical engineering and systems science

We show that two main different regimes appear according to the values of the chosen parameters. We then use this study to construct the law of a (free) stable Langevin process conditioned to stay positive, thus extending earlier works on integrated Brownian motion. This construction further allows to obtain the exact asymptotics of the persistence probability of the integrated stable L{\'e}vy process. In addition, the paper is concluded by solving the associated trace problem in the symmetric case. ",mathematics

Certain mesonic and baryonic excitations, in the presence of a superfluid vortex, have orbital angular momentum quantized in units of $\hbar/3$. Such non-local topological features can distinguish phases whose realizations of global symmetries, as probed by local order parameters, are identical. If $\mathbb{Z}_3$ braiding phases and angular momentum fractionalization are absent in lower density hadronic matter, as is widely expected, then the quark matter and hadronic matter regimes of dense QCD must be separated by at least one phase transition.

"  Ultra-diffuse galaxies have generated significant interest due to their large optical extents and low optical surface brightnesses, which challenge galaxy formation models. Here we present resolved synthesis observations of 12 HI-bearing ultra-diffuse galaxies (HUDs) from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), as well as deep optical imaging from the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. We present the data processing and images, including total intensity HI maps and HI velocity fields. The HUDs show ordered gas distributions and evidence of rotation, important prerequisites for the detailed kinematic models in Mancera Pi\~na et al. (2019b). We compare the HI and stellar alignment and extent, and find the HI extends beyond the already extended stellar component and that the HI disk is often misaligned with respect to the stellar one, emphasizing the importance of caution when approaching inclination measurements for these extreme sources. We explore the HI mass-diameter scaling relation, and find that although the HUDs have diffuse stellar populations, they fall along the relation, with typical global HI surface densities. This resolved sample forms an important basis for more detailed study of the HI distribution in this extreme extragalactic population. ",astrophysics

Our experiments utilize fully integrated silicon-nitride Kerr microresonators, and we demonstrate direct soliton generation with widely available distributed-Bragg-reflector lasers that provide less than 40 mW of chip-coupled laser power. We report measurements of soliton thermal dynamics and demonstrate how rapid laser-frequency control, consistent with the thermal timescale of a microresonator, facilitates stabilization of octave-bandwidth soliton combs. Moreover, since soliton combs are completely described by fundamental linear and nonlinear dynamics of the intraresonator field, we demonstrate the close connection between modeling and generation of octave-bandwidth combs. Our experiments advance the development of self-referenced frequency combs with integrated-photonics technology, and comb-laser sources with tens of terahertz pulse bandwidth across the near-infrared.

"  We consider entanglement purification protocols for multiple copies of qubit states. We use high-dimensional auxiliary entangled systems to learn about number and positions of errors in the noisy ensemble in an explicit and controlled way, thereby reducing the amount of noise in the ensemble and purifying the remaining states. This allows us to design entanglement purification protocols for any number of copies that work particularly well for a small number of expected errors, i.e. high fidelity of initial states. The main tool is a counter gate with which the required non-local information can be transferred into the high-dimensional entangled qudit auxiliary states. We compare our schemes to standard recurrence protocols that operate on pairs of copies, and hashing and breeding protocols that operate on a (asymptotically) large number of copies. Our protocols interpolate between these two regimes, leading to a higher achievable fidelity and yield. We illustrate our approach for bipartite qubit states, and generalize it to purify multi-party GHZ states. ",quantum physics
"  We propose 4-point S-matrices for three-dimensional F-theory. We will use the twistor formalism to facilitate constructing the amplitude. We write the amplitude in a way such that the F-symmetry (U-duality symmetry) is manifest. The amplitude can be schematically written as $A_{4} = w^{4}/stu$, where $w$ is an analog of the linearized Weyl tensor in F-theory, and $w^{4}$ is a shorthand for the sum of various contractions that can happen between the Weyl tensors. The gauge invariance is actually non-trivial since $w$ is in general not gauge invariant. With the help of the twistor formalism, one can verify that this formula is indeed gauge invariant. The amplitude also reduces to the ordinary 4-graviton amplitude under the reduction to M-theory (which is just 4D supergravity). ",high energy physics theory
"  We consider variants of trust-region and cubic regularization methods for non-convex optimization, in which the Hessian matrix is approximated. Under mild conditions on the inexact Hessian, and using approximate solution of the corresponding sub-problems, we provide iteration complexity to achieve $ \epsilon $-approximate second-order optimality which have shown to be tight. Our Hessian approximation conditions constitute a major relaxation over the existing ones in the literature. Consequently, we are able to show that such mild conditions allow for the construction of the approximate Hessian through various random sampling methods. In this light, we consider the canonical problem of finite-sum minimization, provide appropriate uniform and non-uniform sub-sampling strategies to construct such Hessian approximations, and obtain optimal iteration complexity for the corresponding sub-sampled trust-region and cubic regularization methods.

It is shown that for the purpose of joint active and passive beamforming, the knowledge of a large-size cascade channel matrix needs to be acquired. To reduce the training overhead, the inherent sparsity in mmWave channels is exploited. By utilizing properties of Katri-Rao and Kronecker products, we find a sparse representation of the cascade channel and convert cascade channel estimation into a sparse signal recovery problem. Simulation results show that our proposed method can provide an accurate channel estimate and achieve a substantial training overhead reduction. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Upon inclusion of collisions, the speed-limited particle-in-cell (SLPIC) simulation method successfully computed the Paschen curve for argon. The simulations modelled an electron cascade across an argon-filled capacitor, including electron-neutral ionization, electron-neutral elastic collisions, electron-neutral excitation, and ion-induced secondary-electron emission. In electrical breakdown, the timescale difference between ion and electron motion makes traditional particle-in-cell (PIC) methods computationally slow. To decrease this timescale difference and speed up computation, we used SLPIC, a time-domain algorithm that limits the speed of the fastest electrons in the simulation. The SLPIC algorithm facilitates a straightforward, fully-kinetic treatment of dynamics, secondary emission, and collisions. SLPIC was as accurate as PIC, but ran up to 200 times faster. SLPIC accurately computed the Paschen curve for argon over three orders of magnitude in pressure. ",physics
"  We investigate in depth the relation between the first detection time of an isolated quantum system that is repeatedly perturbed by strong local measurements with a large fixed frequency $1/\tau$, determining whether it is in some given state $| \psi_\text{d} \rangle$, and the time of absorption to the same state of the same system with the added imaginary potential $2i\hbar | \psi_\text{d} \rangle \langle \psi_\text{d} | / \tau$. As opposed to previous works, we compare directly the solutions of both problems in the small $\tau$, i.e., Zeno, limit. We find a scaling collapse in $F(t)$ with respect to $\tau$ and compute the total detection probability as well as the moments of the first detection time probability density $F(t)$ in the Zeno limit. We show that both solutions approach the same result in this small $\tau$ limit, as long as the initial state $| \psi_\text{in} \rangle$ is not parallel to the detection state, i.e. as long as $| \langle \psi_\text{d} | \psi_\text{in} \rangle | < 1$. However, when this condition is violated, the small probability density to detect the state on time scales much larger than $\tau$ is precisely a factor of four different for all such times. We express the solution of the Zeno limit of both problems formally in terms of an electrostatic analogy. Our results are corroborated with numerical simulations. ",quantum physics

We observe a variation of the differential ionization probability in a range of several percent. Accordingly, we conclude that the helicity of light is a quantity that should be considered for the theoretical description of the strong field ionization rate of chiral molecules. ",physics

"  The quantum Fisher information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. It is usually challenging to obtain analytical expressions for it because most calculation methods rely on the diagonalization of the density matrix. In this paper, we derive general expressions for the quantum Fisher information matrix which bypass matrix diagonalization and do not require the expansion of operators on an orthonormal set of states. Additionally, we can tackle density matrices of arbitrary rank. The methods presented here simplify analytical calculations considerably when, for example, the density matrix is more naturally expressed in terms of non-orthogonal states, such as coherent states. Our derivation relies on two matrix inverses which, in principle, can be evaluated analytically even when the density matrix is not diagonalizable in closed form. We demonstrate the power of our approach by deriving novel results in the timely field of discrete quantum imaging: the estimation of positions and intensities of incoherent point sources. We find analytical expressions for the full estimation problem of two point sources with different intensities, and for specific examples with three point sources. We expect that our method will become standard in quantum metrology. ",quantum physics

The result for the Euclidean path integral implies that $\widehat{\text{CGHS}}$ is dual to a Gaussian ensemble that we describe in detail. The simplicity of this theory allows us to compute exact quantities such as the quenched free energy and provides a useful playground to study baby universes, averages and factorization. We also give evidence for the existence of a non-perturbative completion in terms of a matrix model. Finally, flat wormhole solutions are discussed. ",high energy physics theory

Once we consider the background metric runs with the deformation parameter $\mu$, the deformation contributes an additional term in conformal killing equation, which plays the role of renormalization group flow of metric. The conformal symmetry coincides with the fixed point. On the gravity side, this deformed conformal killing equation can be described by a new boundary condition of AdS$_3$. In addition, based on the deformed conformal killing equation, we derive that the stress tensor of the deformed CFT equals to Brown-York's quasilocal stress tensor on a finite boundary with a counterterm. For a specific example, BTZ black hole, we get $T\bar T$ deformed conformal killing vectors and the associated conserved charges are also studied. ",high energy physics theory

The presented approach is based on the complex eigenfrequencies of QNMs. The divergence problem is circumvented by using contour integration with an analytical continuation of the far-field quantity into the complex frequency plane. We demonstrate the approach by computing the angular resolved modal energy flux in the far field of a nanophotonic device. ",physics
"  A path in an edge-colored graph is rainbow if no two edges of it are colored the same, and the graph is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices. The minimum number of colors needed to rainbow-connect a graph $G$ is the rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by $\text{rc}(G)$.   A simple way to rainbow-connect a graph $G$ is to color the edges of a spanning tree with distinct colors and then re-use any of these colors to color the remaining edges of $G$. This proves that $\text{rc}(G) \le |V(G)|-1$. We ask whether there is a stronger connection between tree-like structures and rainbow coloring than that is implied by the above trivial argument. For instance, is it possible to find an upper bound of $t(G) -1$ for $\text{rc}(G)$, where $t(G)$ is the number of vertices in the largest induced tree of $G$? The answer turns out to be negative, as there are counter-examples that show that even $c\cdot t(G)$ is not an upper bound for $\text{rc}(G))$ for any given constant $c$.   In this work we show that if we consider the forest number $f(G)$, the number of vertices in a maximum induced forest of $G$, instead of $t(G)$, then surprisingly we do get an upper bound. More specifically, we prove that $\text{rc}(G) \leq f(G) + 2$. Our result indicates a stronger connection between rainbow connection and tree-like structures than that was suggested by the simple spanning tree based upper bound. ",mathematics

"  This paper investigates poisoning attacks against data-driven control methods. This work is motivated by recent trends showing that, in supervised learning, slightly modifying the data in a malicious manner can drastically deteriorate the prediction ability of the trained model. We extend these analyses to the case of data-driven control methods. Specifically, we investigate how a malicious adversary can poison the data so as to minimize the performance of a controller trained using this data. We show that identifying the most impactful attack boils down to solving a bi-level non-convex optimization problem, and provide theoretical insights on the attack. We present a generic algorithm finding a local optimum of this problem and illustrate our analysis in the case of a model-reference based approach, the Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning technique, and on data-driven methods based on Willems et al. lemma. Numerical experiments reveal that minimal but well-crafted changes in the dataset are sufficient to deteriorate the performance of data-driven control methods significantly, and even make the closed-loop system unstable.

"  In this paper, we study the indirect boundary stability and exact controllability of a one-dimensional Timoshenko system. In the first part of the paper, we consider the Timoshenko system with only one boundary fractional damping. We first show that the system is strongly stable but not uniformly stable. Hence, we look for a polynomial decay rate for smooth initial data. Using frequency domain arguments combined with the multiplier method, we prove that the energy decay rate depends on coefficients appearing in the PDE and on the order of the fractional damping. Moreover, under the equal speed propagation condition, we obtain the optimal polynomial energy decay rate. In the second part of this paper, we study the indirect boundary exact controllability of the Timoshenko system with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions and boundary control. Using non-harmonic analysis, we first establish a weak observability inequality, which depends on the ratio of the waves propagation speeds. Next, using the HUM method, we prove that the system is exactly controllable in appropriate spaces and that the control time can be small. ",mathematics

Some peculiar shower events were detected when the neutron signal reveals itself only $\sim$(100--1000)\,$\mu$s after the passage of the shower particles front which probably means an existence of corresponding delay of the muon flux in such events.

"  The voter model with memory-dependent dynamics is theoretically and numerically studied at the mean-field level. The `internal age', or time an individual spends holding the same state, is added to the set of binary states of the population, such that the probability of changing state (or activation probability $p_i$) depends on this age. A closed set of integro-differential equations describing the time evolution of the fraction of individuals with a given state and age is derived, and from it analytical results are obtained characterizing the behavior of the system close to the absorbing states. In general, different age-dependent activation probabilities have different effects on the dynamics. When the activation probability $p_i$ is an increasing function of the age $i$, the system reaches a steady state with coexistence of opinions. In the case of aging, with $p_i$ being a decreasing function, either the system reaches consensus or it gets trapped in a frozen state, depending on the value of $p_\infty$ (zero or not) and the velocity of $p_i$ approaching $p_\infty$. Moreover, when the system reaches consensus, the time ordering of the system can be exponential ($p_\infty>0$) or power-law like ($p_\infty=0$).

"  The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) will be a survey of bright, low redshift galaxies, which is planned to cover an area of ~14,000 sq deg in 3 passes. Each pass will cover the survey area with ~2000 pointings, each of area ~8 sq deg. The BGS is currently proposed to consist of a bright high priority sample to an r-band magnitude limit r ~ 19.5, with a fainter low priority sample to r ~ 20. The geometry of the DESI fibre positioners in the focal plane of the telescope affects the completeness of the survey, and has a non-trivial impact on clustering measurements. Using a BGS mock catalogue, we show that completeness due to fibre assignment primarily depends on the surface density of galaxies. Completeness is high (>95%) in low density regions, but very low (<10%) in the centre of massive clusters. We apply the pair inverse probability (PIP) weighting correction to clustering measurements from a BGS mock which has been through the fibre assignment algorithm. This method is only unbiased if it is possible to observe every galaxy pair. To facilitate this, we randomly promote a small fraction of the fainter sample to be high priority, and dither the set of tile positions by a small angle. We show that inverse pair weighting combined with angular upweighting provides an unbiased correction to galaxy clustering measurements for the complete 3 pass survey, and also after 1 pass, which is highly incomplete.

"  The paper presents a fully explicit algorithm for monotone variational inequalities. The method uses variable stepsizes that are computed using two previous iterates as an approximation of the local Lipschitz constant without running a linesearch. Thus, each iteration of the method requires only one evaluation of a monotone operator $F$ and a proximal mapping $g$. The operator $F$ need not be Lipschitz-continuous, which also makes the algorithm interesting in the area of composite minimization where one cannot use the descent lemma. The method exhibits an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate and $R$-linear rate, if $F, g$ satisfy the error bound condition. We discuss possible applications of the method to fixed point problems. We discuss possible applications of the method to fixed point problems as well as its different generalizations. ",mathematics
"  We report the discovery of an SN1988Z-like type IIn supernova KISS15s found in a low-mass star-forming galaxy at redshift z=0.038 during the course of the Kiso Supernova Survey (KISS). KISS15s shows long-duration optical continuum and emission line light curves, indicating that KISS15s is powered by a continuous interaction between the expanding ejecta and dense circumstellar medium (CSM). The H$\alpha$ emission line profile can be decomposed into four Gaussians of narrow, intermediate, blue-shifted intermediate, and broad velocity width components, with a full width at half maximum of $\lesssim 100$, $\sim 2,000$, and $\sim 14,000$ km s${}^{-1}$ for the narrow, intermediate, and broad components, respectively. The presence of the blue-shifted intermediate component, of which the line-of-sight velocity relative to the systemic velocity is about $-5,000$ km s${}^{-1}$, suggests that the ejecta-CSM interaction region has an inhomogeneous morphology and anisotropic expansion velocity. We found that KISS15s shows increasing infrared continuum emission, which can be interpreted as hot dust thermal emission of $T \sim 1,200$ K from newly formed dust in a cool, dense shell in the ejecta-CSM interaction region. The progenitor mass-loss rate, inferred from bolometric luminosity, is $\dot{M} \sim 0.4 M_{\odot} \text{yr}^{-1} (v_{w}/40 \text{km}~\text{s}^{-1})$, where $v_{w}$ is the progenitor's stellar wind velocity. This implies that the progenitor of KISS15s was a red supergiant star or a luminous blue variable that had experienced a large mass-loss in the centuries before the explosion. ",astrophysics
"  We investigate the effect of groups on a bi-directional flow, by using novel computational methods. Our focus is on self-organisation phenomena, and more specifically on the time needed for the occurrence of pedestrian lanes, their stability and their effect on the velocity-density relation. Moreover, we are interested in understanding the amount of physical contact in the crowd. To this end, we use a novel model considering the asymmetrical shape of the human body and describing its rotation during collision avoidance, and combine it to a mathematical model of group behaviour. We configure several scenarios by varying the global density $\rho$ of pedestrians and the ratio $r_g$ describing the percentage of grouped pedestrians in the simulation. Our results show that the presence of groups has a significant effect on velocity and lane organisation, and a dramatic one on collision. We are well aware of the limitations of our approach, in particular concerning (i) the lack of calibration of body rotation in collision avoidance on actual data and (ii) straightforward application of a low density group model to higher density settings. We nevertheless want to stress that it is not our intention to state that our results reproduce the actual effect of groups on bi-directional flow. In particular, it seems highly unrealistic that crowds with groups collide extremely more often. Nevertheless we believe that our results show the great theoretical and practical implication of the consideration of realistic group behaviour in pedestrian models, and suggest that realistic results may hardly be achieved simply by adding together modular models.

"  We consider the dynamics of particles, particularly focusing on circular orbits in the higher-dimensional Majumdar-Papapetrou (MP) spacetimes with two equal mass black holes. It is widely known that in the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini and Myers-Perry backgrounds, there are no stable circular orbits. In contrast, we show that in the 5D MP background, stable circular orbits can always exist when the separation of two black holes is large enough. More precisely, for a large separation, stable circular orbits exist from the vicinity of horizons to infinity; for a medium one, they appear only in a certain finite region bounded by the innermost stable circular orbit and the outermost stable circular orbit outside the horizons; for a small one, they do not appear at all. Moreover, we show that in MP spacetimes in more than 5D, they do not exist for any separations. ",high energy physics theory
"  In this paper, two new subspace minimization conjugate gradient methods based on $p - $regularization models are proposed, where a special scaled norm in $p - $regularization model is analyzed. Different choices for special scaled norm lead to different solutions to the $p - $regularized subproblem. Based on the analyses of the solutions in a two-dimensional subspace, we derive new directions satisfying the sufficient descent condition. With a modified nonmonotone line search, we establish the global convergence of the proposed methods under mild assumptions. $R - $linear convergence of the proposed methods are also analyzed.

This theory is renormalizable, and hence the failure of tree unitarity is a counter example of Llewellyn Smith's conjecture on the relation between them. We have recently proposed a new conjecture that $S$-matrix unitarity gives the same conditions as renormalizability. We verify that $S$-matrix unitarity holds in the matter-graviton scattering at tree level in the $R_{\mu \nu} ^2$ gravity, demonstrating our new conjecture. ",high energy physics theory

"  A formal expansion for the Green's functions of an interacting quantum field theory in a parameter that somehow encodes its ""distance"" from the corresponding non-interacting one was introduced more than thirty years ago, and has been recently reconsidered in connection with its possible application to the renormalization of non-hermitian theories. Besides this new and interesting application, this expansion has special properties already when applied to ordinary (i.e. hermitian) theories, and in order to disentangle the peculiarities of the expansion itself from those of non-hermitian theories, it is worth to push further the investigation limiting first the analysis to ordinary theories. In the present work we study some aspects related to the renormalization of a scalar theory within the framework of such an expansion. Due to its peculiar properties, it turns out that at any finite order in the expansion parameter the theory looks as non-interacting. We show that when diagrams of appropriate classes are resummed, this apparent drawback disappears and the theory recovers its interacting character. In particular we have seen that with a certain class of diagrams, the weak-coupling expansion results are recovered, thus establishing a bridge between the two expansions.

"  An existence result is presented for the dynamical low rank (DLR) approximation for random semi-linear evolutionary equations. The DLR solution approximates the true solution at each time instant by a linear combination of products of deterministic and stochastic basis functions, both of which evolve over time.

Based on this formulation, the DLR approximation is recast to an abstract Cauchy problem in a suitable linear space, for which existence and uniqueness of the solution in the maximal interval are established.

"  Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) have made indispensable contributions to the development of modern optoelectronic technologies. However, arbitrary beam shaping of VCSELs within a compact system still remains inaccessible till now. The emerging ultra-thin flat optical structures, namely metasurfaces, offer a powerful technique to manipulate electromagnetic fields with subwavelength spatial resolution. Here, we show that the monolithic integration of dielectric metasurfaces with VCSELs enables remarkable arbitrary control of the laser beam profiles, including self-collimation, Bessel and Vortex lasers, with high efficiency. Such wafer-level integration of metasurface through VCSELs-compatible technology simplifies the assembling process and preserves the high performance of the VCSELs.

"  We present a statistical analysis of near-relativistic (NR) solar energetic electron event spectra near 1au. We use measurements of the STEREO Solar Electron and Proton Telescope (SEPT) in the energyrange of 45-425 keV and utilize the SEPT electron event list containing all electron events observed bySTEREO A and STEREO B from 2007 through 2018. We select 781 events with significant signal tonoise ratios for our analysis and fit the spectra with single or broken power law functions of energy.We find 437 (344) events showing broken (single) power laws in the energy range of SEPT. The eventswith broken power laws show a mean break energy of about 120 keV. We analyze the dependence ofthe spectral index on the rise times and peak intensities of the events as well as on the presence ofrelativistic electrons. The results show a relation between the power law spectral index and the risetimes of the events with softer spectra belonging to rather impulsive events. Long rise-time events areassociated with hard spectra as well as with the presence of higher energy (>0.7 MeV) electrons. Thisgroup of events cannot be explained by a pure flare scenario but suggests an additional accelerationmechanism, involving a prolonged acceleration and/or injection of the particles. A dependence of thespectral index on the longitudinal separation from the parent solar source region was not found. Astatistical analysis of the spectral indices during impulsively rising events (rise times<20 minutes) isalso shown. ",astrophysics
"  The paper presents the results of the largest to date VLBI absolute astrometry campaign of observations of 13,645 radio sources with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). Of them, 7220 have been detected, including 6755 target sources that have never been observed with VLBI before. This makes the present VLBI catalogue the largest ever published. Positions of the target sources have been determined with the median uncertainty 1.7 mas, and 15,599 images of 7179 sources have been generated. Unlike to previous absolute radio astrometry campaigns, observations were made at 4.3 and 7.6 GHz simultaneously using a single wide-band receiver. Because of the fine spectral and time resolutions, the field of view was 4 to 8 arcminutes -- much greater than 10 to 20 arcseconds in previous surveys. This made possible to use input catalogues with low position accuracy and detect a compact component in extended sources. Unlike to previous absolute astrometry campaigns, both steep and flat spectrum sources were observed. The observations were scheduled in the so-called fill-in mode to fill the gaps between other high priority programs. That was achieved by development of the totally automatic scheduling procedure.

"  We analyze the known results for the eigenvalue of the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) equation in the perturbative regime using the analytic continuation of harmonic sums from even positive arguments to the complex plane. The resulting meromorphic functions have poles at negative integer values of the argument. The typical classification of harmonic sums is determined by two major parameters: $a)$ the \textit{weight} - a sum of inverse powers of the summation indices; $b)$ the \textit{depth} - a number of nested summations. We introduce the third parameter: the \textit{alternation} - a number of nested sign-alternating summations in a given harmonic sum. We claim that the maximal alternation of the nested summation in the functions building the BFKL eigenvalue is preserved from loop to loop in the perturbative expansion. The BFKL equation is formulated for arbitrary color configuration of the propagating states in the $t$-channel. Based on known results one can state that color adjoint BFKL eigenvalue be can written using only harmonic sums with positive indices, maximal alternation zero, and at most depth one, whereas the singlet BFKL eigenvalue is constructed of harmonic sums with maximal sign alternation being equal one. We also note that for maximal alternation being equal unity the harmonic sums can be expressed through alternation zero harmonic sums with half-shifted arguments. ",high energy physics theory
"  Donsker Theorem is perhaps the most famous invariance principle result for Markov processes. It states that when properly normalized, a random walk behaves asymptotically like a Brownian motion. This approach can be extended to general Markov processes whose driving parameters are taken to a limit, which can lead to insightful results in contexts like large distributed systems or queueing networks. The purpose of this paper is to assess the rate of convergence in these so-called diffusion approximations, in a queueing context. To this end, we extend the functional Stein method introduced for the Brownian approximation of Poisson processes, to two simple examples: the single-server queue and the infinite-server queue. By doing so, we complete the recent applications of Stein's method to queueing systems, with results concerning the whole trajectory of the considered process, rather than its stationary distribution.

"  In this paper, a real-time signal processing frame-work based on a 60 GHz frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar system to recognize gestures is proposed. In order to improve the robustness of the radar-based gesture recognition system, the proposed framework extracts a comprehensive hand profile, including range, Doppler, azimuth and elevation, over multiple measurement-cycles and encodes them into a feature cube. Rather than feeding the range-Doppler spectrum sequence into a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) connected with recurrent neural networks, the proposed framework takes the aforementioned feature cube as input of a shallow CNN for gesture recognition to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a hand activity detection (HAD) algorithm to automatize the detection of gestures in real-time case. The proposed HAD can capture the time-stamp at which a gesture finishes and feeds the hand profile of all the relevant measurement-cycles before this time-stamp into the CNN with low latency. Since the proposed framework is able to detect and classify gestures at limited computational cost, it could be deployed in an edge-computing platform for real-time applications, whose performance is notedly inferior to a state-of-the-art personal computer. The experimental results show that the proposed framework has the capability of classifying 12 gestures in real-time with a high F1-score. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Due to the publicly known and deterministic characteristic of pilot tones, pilot authentication (PA) in multi-user multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems is very susceptible to the jamming/nulling/spoofing behaviors. To solve this, in this paper, we develop a hierarchical 2-D feature (H2DF) coding theory that exploits the hidden pilot signal features, i.e., the energy feature and independence feature, to secure pilot information coding which is applied between legitimate parties through a well-designed five-layer hierarchical coding model to achieve secure multiuser PA (SMPA). The reliability of SMPA is characterized using the identification error probability (IEP) of pilot encoding and decoding with the exact closed-form upper and lower bounds. However, this phenomenon of non-tight bounds brings about the risk of long-term instability in SMPA. Therefore, a reliability bound contraction theory is developed to shrink the bound interval, and practically, this is done by an easy-to-implement technique, namely, codebook partition within the H2DF code. In this process, a tradeoff between the upper and lower bounds of IEP is identified and a problem of optimal upper and lower bound tradeoff is formulated, with the objective of optimizing the cardinality of sub-codebooks such that the upper and lower bounds coincide. Solving this, we finally derive an exact closed-form expression for IEP, which realizes a stable and highly reliable SMPA. Numerical results validate the stability and resilience of H2DF coding in SMPA. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Synthetic creation of drum sounds (e.g., in drum machines) is commonly performed using analog or digital synthesis, allowing a musician to sculpt the desired timbre modifying various parameters. Typically, such parameters control low-level features of the sound and often have no musical meaning or perceptual correspondence. With the rise of Deep Learning, data-driven processing of audio emerges as an alternative to traditional signal processing. This new paradigm allows controlling the synthesis process through learned high-level features or by conditioning a model on musically relevant information. In this paper, we apply a Generative Adversarial Network to the task of audio synthesis of drum sounds. By conditioning the model on perceptual features computed with a publicly available feature-extractor, intuitive control is gained over the generation process. The experiments are carried out on a large collection of kick, snare, and cymbal sounds. We show that, compared to a specific prior work based on a U-Net architecture, our approach considerably improves the quality of the generated drum samples, and that the conditional input indeed shapes the perceptual characteristics of the sounds. Also, we provide audio examples and release the code used in our experiments. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM) nonlinear small-scale structure formation begins before the epoch of recombination due to large Poisson density fluctuations. Those small-scale effects still survive today, distinguishing physics of PBH DM structure formation from the one involving WIMP DM. We construct an analytic model for the small-scale PBH velocities that reproduces the velocity floor seen in numerical simulations, and investigate how these motions impact PBH accretion bounds at different redshifts. We find that the effect is small at the time of recombination, leaving the cosmic microwave background bounds on PBH abundance unchanged. However, already at $z=20$ the PBH internal motion significantly reduces their accretion due to the additional $1/v^6$ suppression, affecting the 21 cm bounds. Today the accretion bounds arising from dwarf galaxies or smaller PBH substructures are all reduced by the PBH velocity floor. We also investigate the feasibility for the PBH clusters to coherently accrete gas leading to a possible enhancement proportional to the cluster's occupation number but find this effect to be insignificant for PBH around $10 M_{\odot}$ or lighter. Those results should be reconsidered if the initial PBH distribution is not Poisson, for example, in the case of large initial PBH clustering. ",astrophysics

"  In this manuscript we compute corrections to the global Casimir effect at zero and finite temperature due to Rainbow's Gravity (parametrized by $\xi$). For this we use the solutions for the scalar field with mass $m$ in the deformed Schwarzschild background and the corresponding quantized energies of the system, which represent the stationary states of the field and yield the stable part of the quantum vacuum energy. The analysis is made here by considering the limit for which the source mass, $M$, approaches zero, in order to verify the effects on the global Casimir effect in mini black holes near to the Planck scale, $\omega_P$. We find a singular behavior for the regularized vacuum energy at zero temperature and for all the corresponding thermodynamic quantities when $m^2=\omega^2_P/\xi$, what can be seen as the limit of validity of the model. Furthermore, we show that the remnant Casimir tension over the event horizon in the limit $M\to 0$ is finite for any temperature and all the space of parameters. In fact we show that the remnant tension receives no corrections from Rainbow's Gravity. This points to the fact that such a behavior may be an universal property of this kind of system.

Casting the time-periodic solution of the parabolic partial differential equation as a fixed point problem and a convex optimisationproblem, we give sufficient conditions in which the partial differential equation is well-posed in a weak and classical sense. With no known closed formulae for the expected exit time, we show our method can be readily implemented by standard numerical schemes.

Similar results are derived for quasi-stationary distributions. The approach to establish tail asymptotics is different from the classical semimartingale approach.

"  The tidal force from a supermassive black hole can rip apart a star that passes close enough in what is known as a Tidal Disruption Event. Typically half of the destroyed star remains bound to the black hole and falls back on highly eccentric orbits, forming an accretion flow which powers a luminous flare. In this paper we use analytical and numerical calculations to explore the effect of stellar rotation on the fallback rate of material. We find that slowly spinning stars ($\Omega_* \lesssim 0.01 \Omega_{\rm{breakup}}$) provide only a small perturbation to fallback rates found in the non-spinning case. However when the star spins faster, there can be significant effects. If the star is spinning retrograde with respect to its orbit the tidal force from the black hole has to spin down the star first before disrupting it, causing delayed and sometimes only partial disruption events. However, if the star is spinning prograde this works with the tidal force and the material falls back sooner and with a higher peak rate. We examine the power-law index of the fallback curves, finding that in all cases the fallback rate overshoots the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate briefly after the peak, with the depth of the overshoot dependent on the stellar spin. We also find that in general the late time evolution is slightly flatter than the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ rate. We therefore conclude that considering the spin of the star may be important in modelling observed TDE lightcurves. ",astrophysics

In this paper we show how to directly relate the $n$-point correlators of the two sides to one another. In particular, we argue that the correlators of the world-sheet theory are delta-function-localised in string moduli space to those configurations that allow for a holomorphic covering map of the $\text{S}^2$-boundary of $\text{AdS}_3$ by the world-sheet. This striking feature can be seen both from a careful Ward identity analysis, as well as from semi-classically exact AdS$_3$ solutions that are pinned to the boundary. The world-sheet correlators therefore have exactly the same structure as in the Lunin-Mathur construction of symmetric orbifold CFT correlators in terms of a covering surface -- which now gets identified with the world-sheet. Together with the results of arXiv:1803.04423 and arXiv:1812.01007 this essentially demonstrates how the $k=1$ $\text{AdS}_3$ string theory becomes equivalent to the spacetime orbifold CFT in the genus expansion.

"  Quantum technology is seeing a remarkable explosion in interest due to a wave of successful commercial technology. As a wider array of engineers and scientists are needed, it is time we rethink quantum educational paradigms. Current approaches often start from classical physics, linear algebra, or differential equations. This chapter advocates for beginning with probability theory. In the approach outlined in this chapter, there is less in the way of explicit axioms of quantum mechanics. Instead the historically problematic measurement axiom is inherited from probability theory where many philosophical debates remain. Although not a typical route in introductory material, this route is nonetheless a standard vantage on quantum mechanics. This chapter outlines an elementary route to arrive at the Schr\""odinger equation by considering allowable transformations of quantum probability functions (density matrices). The central tenet of this chapter is that probability theory provides the best conceptual and mathematical foundations for introducing the quantum sciences. ",physics
"  Recently, a camera or an image sensor receiver based optical wireless communications (OWC) techniques have attracted particular interest in areas such as the internet of things, indoor localization, motion capture, and intelligent transportation systems. As a supplementary technique of high-speed OWC based on photo-detectors, communications hinging on image sensors as receivers do not need much modification to the current infrastructure, such that the implementation complexity and cost are quite low. Therefore, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of optical camera communication (OCC) techniques, and their use in localization, navigation, and motion capture. This survey is distinguishable from the existing reviews on this topic by covering multiple aspects of OCC and its various applications. The first part of the paper focuses on the standardization, channel characterization, modulation, coding, and synchronization of OCC systems while the second part of the article presents the literature on OCC based localization, navigation, and motion capture. Finally, in the last part of the paper, we present the challenges and future research directions of OCC. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  The mean value theorem of calculus states that, given a differentiable function $f$ on an interval $[a, b]$, there exists at least one mean value abscissa $c$ such that the slope of the tangent line at $c$ is equal to the slope of the secant line through $(a, f(a))$ and $(b, f(b))$. In this article, we study how the choices of $c$ relate to varying the right endpoint $b$. In particular, we ask: When we can write $c$ as a continuous function of $b$ in some interval?   Drawing inspiration from graphed examples, we first investigate this question by proving and using a simplified implicit function theorem. To handle certain edge cases, we then build on this analysis to prove and use a simplified Morse's lemma. Finally, further developing the tools proved so far, we conclude that if $f$ is analytic, then it is always possible to choose mean value abscissae so that $c$ is a continuous function of $b$, at least locally.

"  Near lightcone correlators are dominated by operators with the lowest twist. We consider the contributions of such leading lowest twist multi-stress tensor operators to a heavy-heavy-light-light correlator in a CFT of any even dimensionality with a large central charge. An infinite number of such operators contribute, but their sum is described by a simple ansatz. We show that the coefficients in this ansatz can be determined recursively, thereby providing an operational procedure to compute them. This is achieved by bootstrapping the corresponding near lightcone correlator: conformal data for any minimal-twist determines that for the higher minimal-twist and so on. To illustrate this procedure in four spacetime dimensions we determine the contributions of double- and triple-stress tensors. We compute the OPE coefficients; whenever results are available in the literature, we observe complete agreement. We also compute the contributions of double-stress tensors in six spacetime dimensions and determine the corresponding OPE coefficients. In all cases the results are consistent with the exponentiation of the near lightcone correlator. This is similar to the situation in two spacetime dimensions for the Virasoro vacuum block.

"  In the presence of longitudinal coherent electron cooling, the evolution of the line-density profile of a circulating ion bunch can be described by the 1-D Fokker-Planck equation. We show that, in the absence of diffusion, the 1-D equation can be solved analytically for certain dependence of cooling force on the synchrotron amplitude. For more general cases with arbitrary diffusion, we solved the 1-D Fokker-Planck equation numerically and the numerical solutions have been compared with results from macro-particle tracking.

"  Using a sample of galaxies at $z\approx 3$ with detected Lyman Continuum (LyC) leakage in the SSA22 field, we attempt to verify a proposed indirect method for identifying cases with high LyC escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ based on measurements of the H$\beta$ equivalent width (EW) and the $\beta$ slope of the UV continuum. To this end, we present Keck/MOSFIRE H$\beta$ emission line flux measurements of LyC galaxies (LCGs) at spectroscopic redshifts $z_{\mathrm{spec}} \sim 3.3$, Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at photometric redshifts $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 2.7$--$3.7$, and Ly$\alpha$ emitters at $z_{\mathrm{phot}} = 3.1$. We also reconfirm the spectroscopic redshifts and measure the H$\beta$ emission line fluxes from 2 LCGs and 6 LBGs. For the LCG in our sample with the most extreme $f_\mathrm{esc}$, as revealed by the direct detection of LyC photons, we find that the EW(H$\beta$)--$\beta$ method gives a broadly consistent estimate for $f_\mathrm{esc}$, although the error bars remain very large. We also discuss how a combination of $f_\mathrm{esc}$ measurements based on direct and indirect methods can shed light on the LyC escape mechanism and the anisotropy of the leakage. ",astrophysics
"  The low-energy behavior of near-extremal black holes can be understood from the near-horizon AdS_2 region. In turn, this region is effectively described by using Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity coupled to Yang-Mills theory through the two-dimensional metric and the dilaton field. We show that such a two-dimensional model of gravity coupled to gauge fields is soluble for an arbitrary choice of gauge group and gauge couplings. Specifically, we determine the partition function of the theory on two-dimensional surfaces of arbitrary genus and with an arbitrary number of boundaries. When solely focusing on the contribution from surfaces with disk topology, we show that the gravitational gauge theory is described by the Schwarzian theory coupled to a particle moving on the gauge group manifold. When considering the contribution from all genera, we show that the theory is described by a particular double-scaled matrix integral, where the elements of the matrix are functions that map the gauge group manifold to complex or real numbers. Finally, we compute the expectation value of various diffeomorphism invariant observables in the gravitational gauge theory and find their exact boundary description. ",high energy physics theory
"  A map of 100 degrees on a side extracted from Gaia DR2 and centred on Alpha Persei reveals two distinct structures | the Alpha Persei star cluster and a conspicuous stellar stream, as widely documented in recent literature. In this work we employ DBSCAN to assess individual stars' membership and attempt at separating stars belonging to the cluster and to the stream from the general field. In turn, we characterize the stream and investigate its relation with the cluster. The stream population turned out to be significantly older (5+/-1Gyr) than the cluster, and to be positioned ~90 pc away from the cluster, in its background. The stream exhibits a sizeable thickness of ~180 pc in the direction of the line of view. Finally, the stream harbours a prominent population of white dwarf stars. We estimated an upper limit of the stream mass of ~6000 solar masses?. The stream would therefore be the leftover of a relatively massive old cluster. The surface density map of the Alpha Persei evidences the presence of tidal tails. While it is tempting to ascribe them to the interaction with the disrupting old star cluster, we prefer to believe, conservatively, they are of Galactic origin. ",astrophysics
"  Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have been intensively used for solving discrete quadratic optimization problems, in particular in the binary case. For the general non-convex integer case with box constraints, the branch-and-bound algorithm Q-MIST has been proposed by Buchheim and Wiegele (Math Program 141(1--2):435--452, 2013), which is based on an extension of the well-known SDP-relaxation for max-cut. For solving the resulting SDPs, Q-MIST uses an off-the-shelf interior point algorithm.   In this paper, we present a tailored coordinate ascent algorithm for solving the dual problems of these SDPs. Building on related ideas of Dong (SIAM J Optim 26(3):1962--1985, 2016), it exploits the particular structure of the SDPs, most importantly a small rank of the constraint matrices. The latter allows both an exact line search and a fast incremental update of the inverse matrices involved, so that the entire algorithm can be implemented to run in quadratic time per iteration. Moreover, we describe how to extend this approach to a certain two-dimensional coordinate update. Finally, we explain how to include arbitrary linear constraints into this framework, and evaluate our algorithm experimentally. ",mathematics

"  The galling behaviour of 316L stainless steel was investigated in both the unoxidised and oxidised states, after exposure in simulated PWR water for 850 hours. Galling testing was performed according to ASTM G196 in ambient conditions. 316L was found to gall by the wedge growth and flow mechanism in both conditions. This resulted in folds ahead of the prow and adhesive junction, forming a heavily sheared multilayered prow. The galling trough was seen to have failed through successive shear failure during wedge flow. Immediately beneath the surface a highly sheared nanocrystalline layer was seen, termed the tribologically affected zone (TAZ). It was observed that strain-induced martensite formed within the TAZ. Galling damage was quantified using Rt (maximum height - maximum depth) and galling area (the proportion of the sample which is considered galled), and it was shown that both damage measures decreased significantly on the oxidised samples. At an applied normal stress of 4.2 MPa the galled area was 14 % vs. 1.2 % and the Rt was 780 um vs. 26 um for the unoxidised and oxidised sample respectively. This trend was present at higher applied normal stresses, although less prominent. This difference in galling behaviour is likely to be a result of a reduction in adhesion in the case of the oxidised surface. ",physics
"  The standard model for the formation of structure assumes that there existed small fluctuations in the early universe that grew due to gravitational instability. The origins of these fluctuations are as yet unclear. In this work we propose the role of dark matter in providing the seed for star formation in the early universe. Very recent observations also support the role of dark matter in the formation of these first stars. With this we set observable constraints on luminosities, temperatures, and lifetimes of these early stars with an admixture of dark matter. ",astrophysics
"  The deconvolution, or cleaning, of radio interferometric images often involves computing model visibilities from a list of clean components, in order that the contribution from the model can be subtracted from the observed visibilities. This step is normally performed using a forward fast Fourier transform (FFT), followed by a 'degridding' step that interpolates over the uv plane to construct the model visibilities. An alternative approach is to calculate the model visibilities directly by summing over all the members of the clean component list, which is a more accurate method that can also be much slower. However, if the clean components are used to construct a model image on the surface of the celestial sphere then the model visibilities can be generated directly from the wavelet coefficients, and the sparsity of the model means that most of these coefficients are zero, and can be ignored. We have constructed a prototype imager that uses a spherical-wavelet representation of the model image to generate model visibilities during each major cycle, and find empirically that the execution time scales with the wavelet resolution level, J, as O(1.07 J), and with the number of distinct clean components, N_C, as O(N_C). The prototype organises the wavelet coefficients into a tree structure, and does not store or process the zero wavelet coefficients. ",astrophysics
"  Extreme events that arise spontaneously in chaotic dynamical systems often have an adverse impact on the system or the surrounding environment. As such, their mitigation is highly desirable. Here, we introduce a novel control strategy for mitigating extreme events in a turbulent shear flow. The controller combines a probabilistic prediction of the extreme events with a deterministic actuator. The predictions are used to actuate the controller only when an extreme event is imminent. When actuated, the controller only acts on the degrees of freedom that are involved in the formation of the extreme events, exerting minimal interference with the flow dynamics. As a result, the attractors of the controlled and uncontrolled systems share the same chaotic core (containing the non-extreme events) and only differ in the tail of their distributions. We propose that such adaptive low-dimensional controllers should be used to mitigate extreme events in general chaotic dynamical systems, beyond the shear flow considered here. ",physics

"  Identifying power-law scaling in real networks - indicative of preferential attachment - has proved controversial. Critics argue that measuring the temporal evolution of a network directly is better than measuring the degree distribution when looking for preferential attachment. However, many of the established methods do not account for any potential time-dependence in the attachment kernels of growing networks, or methods assume that node degree is the key observable determining network evolution. In this paper, we argue that these assumptions may lead to misleading conclusions about the evolution of growing networks. We illustrate this by introducing a simple adaptation of the Barab{\'a}si-Albert model, the ""k2 model"", where new nodes attach to nodes in the existing network in proportion to the number of nodes one or two steps from the target node. The k2 model results in time dependent degree distributions and attachment kernels, despite initially appearing to grow as linear preferential attachment, and without the need to include explicit time dependence in key network parameters (such as the average out-degree). We show that similar effects are seen in several real world networks where constant network growth rules do not describe their evolution. This implies that measurements of specific degree distributions in real networks are also likely to change over time. ",physics
"  In this paper we propose a new class of iterative regularization methods for solving ill-posed linear operator equations. The prototype of these iterative regularization methods is in the form of second order evolution equation with a linear vanishing damping term, which can be viewed not only as an extension of the asymptotical regularization, but also as a continuous analog of the Nesterov's acceleration scheme. New iterative regularization methods are derived from this continuous model in combination with damped symplectic numerical schemes. The regularization property as well as convergence rates and acceleration effects under the H\""older-type source conditions of both continuous and discretized methods are proven.   The second part of this paper is concerned with the application of the newly developed accelerated iterative regularization methods to the diffusion-based bioluminescence tomography, which is modeled as an inverse source problem in elliptic partial differential equations with both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary data. A relaxed mathematical formulation is proposed so that the discrepancy principle can be applied to the iterative scheme without the usage of Sobolev embedding constants. Several numerical examples, as well as a comparison with the state-of-the-art methods, are given to show the accuracy and the acceleration effect of the new methods. ",mathematics
"  We consider exact deterministic mixed-integer programming (MIP) reformulations of distributionally robust chance-constrained programs (DR-CCP) with random right-hand sides over Wasserstein ambiguity sets. The existing MIP formulations are known to have weak continuous relaxation bounds, and, consequently, for hard instances with small radius, or with large problem sizes, the branch-and-bound based solution processes suffer from large optimality gaps even after hours of computation time. This significantly hinders the practical application of the DR-CCP paradigm. Motivated by these challenges, we conduct a polyhedral study to strengthen these formulations. We reveal several hidden connections between DR-CCP and its nominal counterpart (the sample average approximation), mixing sets, and robust 0-1 programming. By exploiting these connections in combination, we provide an improved formulation and two classes of valid inequalities for DR-CCP. We test the impact of our results on a stochastic transportation problem numerically. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; in particular our improved formulation and proposed valid inequalities reduce the overall solution times remarkably. Moreover, this allows us to significantly scale up the problem sizes that can be handled in such DR-CCP formulations by reducing the solution times from hours to seconds. ",mathematics

"  Binary neutron star associated with short gamma-ray burst has drawn wide attention ever since the observation of GW170817, due to its prospect in cosmology. While further application of this sort of event suffers from the problem of degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination angle. To address this issue, proposed in previous research is the utilization of information from short gamma-ray burst. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effect of different Gaussian priors of the inclination angle. To test the property of resulting posterior distribution, we generate four catalogues of 1000 events by varying the number of third-generation detectors and the scale of prior. It turns out that a network of detectors tends to recognize more and farther events than a single detector. Besides, adopting tighter prior and employing multiple detectors both lead to lower error at given redshifts. Also considered is the validity of a widely adopted formula $\sigma_{\Delta d_{\rm L}0} = 2d_{\rm L} / \rho$, which undergoes the change from overestimating to underestimating with the increase of redshift. In the case of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, 800, 300, 800 and 600 events are required for the four configurations to achieve $1\%$ $H_0$ accuracy. With all 1000 events in each catalogue, $H_0$ can be constrained to $0.90\%$, $0.60\%$, $0.91\%$ and $0.77\%$, while the errors of $\Omega_m$ are 0.014, 0.010, 0.018 and 0.016 respectively. Besides, adopting $\sigma_{\Delta d_{\rm L}0}$ leads to underestimation on the errors of cosmological parameters for tighter prior and overestimation in the opposite case. Results of Gaussian process also show that gravitational wave standard siren can reach higher redshift than traditional standard candles, especially when a network of detector is available, while alteration of the prior only has moderate impact.

"  The development and validation of 3D multiphase computational fluid dynamics (M-CFD) models and physics-informed data-driven modeling require data of high-quality and high-resolution.

"  In this paper we propose a novel approach to compute the Koopman operator from sparse time series data. In recent years there has been considerable interests in operator theoretic methods for data-driven analysis of dynamical systems. Existing techniques for the approximation of the Koopman operator require sufficiently large data sets, but in many applications, the data set may not be large enough to approximate the operators to acceptable limits. In this paper, using ideas from robust optimization, we propose an algorithm to compute the Koopman operator from sparse data. We enrich the sparse data set with artificial data points, generated by adding bounded artificial noise and and formulate the noisy robust learning problem as a robust optimization problem and show that the optimal solution is the Koopman operator with smallest error. We illustrate the efficiency of our proposed approach in three different dynamical systems, namely, a linear system, a nonlinear system and a dynamical system governed by a partial differential equation.

"  It is known that the anomalous Chern-Simons (CS) coupling of O$_p$-plane is not consistent with the T-duality transformations. Compatibility of this coupling with the T-duality requires the inclusion of couplings involving one R-R field strength. In this paper we find such couplings at order $\alpha'^2$.   By requiring the R-R and NS-NS gauge invariances, we first find all independent couplings at order $\alpha'^2$. There are $1,\, 6,\,28,\,20,\, 19,\, 2$ couplings corresponding to the R-R field strengths $F^{(p-4)}$, $\,F^{(p-2)}$, $\,F^{(p)}$, $\,F^{(p+2)}$, $\,F^{(p+4)}$ and $F^{(p+6)}$, respectively. We then impose the T-duality constraint on these couplings and on the CS coupling $C^{(p-3)}\wedge R\wedge R$ at order $\alpha'^2$ to fix their corresponding coefficients. The T-duality constraint fixes all coefficients in terms of the CS coefficient. They are fully consistent with the partial couplings that have been already found in the literature by the S-matrix method. ",high energy physics theory
"  Target imbalance affects the performance of recent deep learning methods in many medical image segmentation tasks. It is a twofold problem: class imbalance - positive class (lesion) size compared to negative class (non-lesion) size; lesion size imbalance - large lesions overshadows small ones (in the case of multiple lesions per image). While the former was addressed in multiple works, the latter lacks investigation. We propose a loss reweighting approach to increase the ability of the network to detect small lesions. During the learning process, we assign a weight to every image voxel. The assigned weights are inversely proportional to the lesion volume, thus smaller lesions get larger weights. We report the benefit from our method for well-known loss functions, including Dice Loss, Focal Loss, and Asymmetric Similarity Loss. Additionally, we compare our results with other reweighting techniques: Weighted Cross-Entropy and Generalized Dice Loss. Our experiments show that inverse weighting considerably increases the detection quality, while preserves the delineation quality on a state-of-the-art level.

  A generic half-BPS surface defect of ${\mathcal N}=4$ supersymmetric U$(N)$ Yang-Mills theory is described by a partition of $N = n_1 + \ldots + n_M$ and a set of $4M$ continuous parameters.

This system is decoupled and linearized using the Gummel method and the resulting equations are discretized using a local DG scheme.

"  The dependence of the diffusion MRI signal on the diffusion time $t$ is a hallmark of tissue microstructure at the scale of the diffusion length. Here we measure the time-dependence of the mean diffusivity $D(t)$ and mean kurtosis $K(t)$ in cortical gray matter and in 25 gray matter sub-regions, in 10 healthy subjects. Significant diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence is observed for $t=21.2$-100 ms, and is characterized by a power-law tail $\sim t^{-\vartheta}$ with dynamical exponent $\vartheta$. To interpret our measurements, we systematize the relevant scenarios and mechanisms for diffusion time-dependence in the brain. Using effective medium theory formalisms, we derive an exact relation between the power-law tails in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$. The estimated power-law dynamical exponent $\vartheta\simeq1/2$ in both $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ is consistent with one-dimensional diffusion in the presence of randomly positioned restrictions along neurites. We analyze the short-range disordered statistics of synapses on axon collaterals in the cortex, and perform one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion restricted by permeable barriers with a similar randomness in their placement, to confirm the $\vartheta=1/2$ exponent. In contrast, the K\""arger model of exchange is less consistent with the data since it does not capture the diffusivity time-dependence, and the estimated exchange time from $K(t)$ falls below our measured $t$-range. Although we cannot exclude exchange as a contributing factor, we argue that structural disorder along neurites is mainly responsible for the observed time-dependence of diffusivity and kurtosis. Our observation and theoretical interpretation of the $t^{-1/2}$ tail in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ alltogether establish the sensitivity of a macroscopic MRI signal to micrometer-scale structural heterogeneities along neurites in human gray matter in vivo.

"  In this paper, we present two deep learning-based hybrid data-driven reduced order models for the prediction of unsteady fluid flows. The first model projects the high-fidelity time series data from a finite element Navier-Stokes solver to a low-dimensional subspace via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The time-dependent coefficients in the POD subspace are propagated by the recurrent net (closed-loop encoder-decoder updates) and mapped to a high-dimensional state via the mean flow field and POD basis vectors. This model is referred as POD-RNN. The second model, referred to as convolution recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN), employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) as layers of linear kernels with nonlinear activations, to extract low-dimensional features from flow field snapshots. The flattened features are advanced using a recurrent (closed-loop manner) net and up-sampled (transpose convoluted) gradually to high-dimensional snapshots. Two benchmark problems of the flow past a cylinder and flow past a side-by-side cylinder are selected as the test problems to assess the efficacy of these models. For the problem of flow past a single cylinder, the performance of both the models is satisfactory, with CRAN being a bit overkill. However, it completely outperforms the POD-RNN model for a more complicated problem of flow past side-by-side cylinders. Owing to the scalability of CRAN, we briefly introduce an observer-corrector method for the calculation of integrated pressure force coefficients on the fluid-solid boundary on a reference grid. This reference grid, typically a structured and uniform grid, is used to interpolate scattered high-dimensional field data as snapshot images. These input images are convenient in training CRAN. This motivates us to further explore the application of CRAN models for the prediction of fluid flows. ",physics

"  In a one-dimensional (1D) disordered potential, quantum interferences leading to Anderson lo-calization are ubiquitous, such that all wave-functions are exponentially localized. Moreover, no phase transition toward delocalization is expected in 1D. This behavior is strongly modified in the presence of a bias force. We experimentally study this case, launching a non-interacting 39 K Bose-Einstein condensate in a 1D disordered potential induced by a far-off-resonance laser speckle, while controlling a bias force. In agreement with theoretical predictions, we observe a transition between algebraic localization and delocalization as a function of our control parameter that is the relative strength of the disorder against the bias force. We also demonstrate that the initial velocity of the wave-packet only plays a role through an effective disorder strength due to the correlation of the disorder. Adding a bias force is a quite natural way to probe the transport properties of quantum systems, a subject of broad interest that can be in particular addressed with atomic quantum gases thanks to their high degree of control and versatility [1]. For example, Bloch oscillations has been measured through the addition of a constant force to atoms in periodic potential induced by an optical lattice [2]. A force applied to a harmonic trap is equivalent to a trap displacement. The response to such a displacement permits to reveal the fluid or insulating behavior of atomic systems. In 1D interacting Bose gases, the pinning transition by an optical lattice [3] or the insulating transition in quasi-disordered optical lattice [4, 5] have been studied in this manner. More recently, transport in quantum gases is also studied in junction-type setup more analogous to condensed-matter systems: two reservoirs with different chemical potentials are connected through a constriction. For example, in a gas of fermions, the quantization of conductance through a quantum point contact [6] and the superfluid to normal transition in a disordered thin film have been observed [7]. In our work, we focus on the transport of non-interacting particles in disordered media. Without a bias force, quantum interferences between multiple paths lead to Anderson localization [8] whose signature is an exponential decay in space of single particle wave-function [9]. This phenomenon is ubiquitous in wave/quantum physics and it has been observed in many physical contexts [10] including condensed-matter [11] and ultra-cold atoms [12-14]. One-dimensional truly disordered systems are always localized [15], contrary to the 3D case where a phase transition between localized and extended single particle wave-functions takes place as a function of the disorder strength [16-18]. The localization properties of 1D disordered systems are modified in the presence of a bias force. Theoretical studies predict a transition from algebraic localization to delocalization as a function of a single control non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ which is the ratio of the force to the disorder strength [19, 20]. Physically, $\alpha$ is the relative energy gain $\Delta$E/E of a particle of energy E when moving over a localization length. Interestingly, in a 1D white noise disorder, this quantity is independent of E as the localization length is proportional to E. If $\alpha$ is small, the force does not considerably change the localization behavior of the particle while for large $\alpha$ its dynamics is severely affected leading to delocalization. This localization-delocalization transition is predicted in the infinite time limit for white noise disorder [20]. In a correlated disorder, as the one produced from a far-off-resonance laser speckle [21], the situation is more complicated. Speckles have no Fourier component beyond a spatial frequency 2k c. As a consequence, back-scattering and localization are not expected in the framework of Born approximation for atoms with wavevectors k > k c [12, 22]. Since localized wave-functions always have a small fraction at long distance corresponding to large energies and momenta in the presence of a bias force, we thus expect correlation-induced delocalization at infinite time. However, signatures of the algebraic localization-delocalization transition are predicted to be observable at transient times [20]. In this paper, we report on the observation of the algebraic localization-delocalization transition with cold-atoms propagating in a one dimensional disordered potential in the presence of a controlled bias force. We experimentally show that the non-dimensional parameter $\alpha$ is the only relevant parameter to describe the transition. We notice that the initial velocity of the quantum wave packet only plays a role through the correlation of the disordered potential, showing that the transition is in-trinsically energy independent. In the localized regime, we demonstrate an algebraic decay of the density and measure the corresponding decay exponent as a function of $\alpha$.

"  The direct and indirect boundary element methods, accelerated via the fast multipole method, are applied to numerical simulation of room acoustics for large rooms of volume $\sim 150$ $m^{3}$ and frequencies up to 5 kHz on a workstation. As the parameter $kD$ (wavenumber times room diameter) is large, stabilization of the previously developed FMM algorithms is required for accuracy. A stabilization scheme is one of the key contribution of this paper. The computations are validated using well-known image source solutions for shoebox shaped rooms. Computations for L-shaped rooms are performed to illustrate the ability to capture diffractions. The ability to model in-room baffles, and boundary openings (doors/windows) is also demonstrated. The largest case has $kD>1100$ with a discretization of size 6 million elements. The performance of different boundary integral formulations was compared, and their rates of convergence using a preconditioned flexible GMRES were found to be substantially different. These promising results suggest a path to efficient simulations of room acoustics via high performance boundary element methods. ",mathematics
"  The growing sample of LIGO-Virgo black holes (BHs) opens new perspectives for the study of massive binary evolution. Here, we study the impact of mass accretion efficiency on the properties of binary BH (BBH) mergers, by means of population synthesis simulations. We model mass accretion efficiency with the parameter $f_{\rm MT}\in[0.05,1]$, which represents the fraction of mass lost from the donor which is effectively accreted by the companion. Lower values of $f_{\rm MT}$ result in lower BBH merger rate densities and produce mass spectra skewed towards lower BH masses. Our hierarchical Bayesian analysis, applied to BBH mergers in the first and second observing run of LIGO-Virgo, yields almost zero support for values of $f_{\rm MT}\le{}0.3$. This result holds for all the values of the common-envelope efficiency parameter we considered in this study ($\alpha_{\rm CE}=1,$ 5 and 10). The lower boundaries of the 95% credible intervals are equal to $f_{\rm MT}= 0.40,0.45$ and 0.48 for $\alpha_{\rm CE}= 1,$ 5 and 10, respectively. This confirms that future gravitational-wave data can be used to put constraints on several uncertain binary evolution processes. ",astrophysics
"  In the action-complexity proposal there are two different methods to regularize the gravitational on-shell action, which are equivalent in the framework of AdS/CFT. In this paper, we want to study the equivalence of them for a pure BTZ black hole microstate. The microstate is obtained from a two-sided BTZ black hole truncated by a dynamical timelike ETW brane. Moreover, it is dual to a finite energy pure state in a two-dimensional CFT. We show that if one includes the timelike counterterms inspired by holographic renormalization as well as the Gibbons-Hawking-York term on the timelike boundary of the WDW patch, which exists in one of the regularizations, the coefficients of the UV divergent terms of action-complexity in the two methods become equal to each other. Furthermore, we compare the finite terms of action-complexity in both regularizations, and show that when the UV cutoff surface is close enough to the asymptotic boundary of the bulk spacetime, action-complexities in both regularizations become exactly equal to each other.

"  We present a method to calculate an upper bound on the generation of entanglement in any spin system using the Fannes-Audenaert inequality for the von Neumann entropy. Our method not only is useful for efficiently estimating entanglement, but also shows that entanglement generation depends on the distance of the quantum states of the system from corresponding minimum-uncertainty spin coherent states (SCSs). We illustrate our method using a quantum kicked top model, and show that our upper bound is a very good estimator for entanglement generated in both regular and chaotic regions. In a deep quantum regime, the upper bound on entanglement can be high in both regular and chaotic regions, while in the semiclassical regime, the bound is higher in chaotic regions where the quantum states diverge from the corresponding SCSs. Our analysis thus explains previous studies and clarifies the relationship between chaos and entanglement. ",quantum physics
"  Our purpose is to introduce in the setting of locally compact groupoids the analogues of the well known equivalent definitions of exactness for discrete groups. We study the relations between these notions. The best results are obtained for a class of \'etale groupoids that we call inner amenable, since for locally compact groups this notion coincides with the notion of inner amenability. We give examples of such groupoids which include transformation groupoids associated to actions of discrete groups by homeomorphisms on locally compact spaces. We have no example of \'etale groupoids which are not inner amenable. For inner amenable \'etale groupoids we extend what is known for discrete groups in proving the equivalence of six natural notions of exactness: (1) strong amenability at infinity; (2) amenability at infinity; (3) nuclearity of the uniform (Roe) algebra of the groupoid; (4) exactness of this $C^*$-algebra; (5) exactness of the reduced $C^*$-algebra; (6) exactness of the groupoid in the sense of Kirchberg-Wassermann.   We give several illustrations of our results and review the results obtained by several authors that highlight the crucial role of exactness in order to clarify the relation between the amenability of a groupoid and the fact that its full and reduced $C^*$-algebras coincide. We end our paper with open questions and an appendix on fibrewise compactifications because our work requires to extend from discrete groups to \'etale groupoids the notion of Stone-Cech compactification on which the groupoid acts.

"  Massless particles in $n+1$ dimensions lead to massive particles in $n$ dimensions on Kaluza-Klein reduction. In string theory, wrapped branes lead to multiplets of massive particles in $n$ dimensions, in representations of a duality group $G$. By encoding the masses of these particles in auxiliary worldline scalars, also transforming under $G$, we write an action which resembles that for a massless particle on an extended spacetime. We associate this extended spacetime with that appearing in double field theory and exceptional field theory, and formulate a version of the action which is invariant under the generalised diffeomorphism symmetry of these theories. This provides a higher-dimensional perspective on the origin of mass and tension in string theory and M-theory. Finally, we consider the reduction of exceptional field theory on a twisted torus, which is known to give the massive IIA theory of Romans. In this case, our particle action leads naturally to the action for a D0 brane in massive IIA. Here an extra vector field is present on the worldline, whose origin in exceptional field theory is a vector field introduced to ensure invariance under generalised diffeomorphisms.

In spite of the highly mixed character of the density matrix of this system, the numerical approach is able to provide precise estimations of the steady-state expectation values, even for large lattices made of more than 100 sites. By performing a finite-size scaling of the relevant properties of the steady state, we extrapolate the behavior of the system in the thermodynamic limit and we show the emergence of a second-order dissipative phase transition, belonging to the universality class of thermal Ising model. This result indicates the occurrence of a crossover when the loss rate is increased from the weak-loss limit, in which the phase transition belongs to the universality class of the quantum Ising model ",quantum physics

We here present an efficient scheme to generate stable multiparticle entanglement in a solid state setup, where an array of silicon-vacancy centers are embedded in a quasi-one-dimensional acoustic diamond waveguide. In this scheme, the continuum of phonon modes induces a controllable dissipative coupling among the SiV centers. We show that, by an appropriate choice of the distance between the SiV centers, the dipole-dipole interactions can be switched off due to destructive interferences, thus realizing a Dicke superradiance model. This gives rise to an entangled steady state of SiV centers with high fidelities. The protocol provides a feasible setup for the generation of multiparticle entanglement in a solid state system.

Here we study numerically electromagnetic vector wave transmittance through realistic digital representations of hyperuniform dielectric networks, a new class of highly correlated but disordered photonic band gap materials. We identify the evanescent decay of the transmitted power in the gap and diffusive transport far from the gap. Near the gap, we find that transport sets off diffusive but, with increasing slab thickness, crosses over gradually to a faster decay, signaling localization. We show that we can describe the transition to localization at the mobility edge using the self-consistent theory of localization based on the concept of a position-dependent diffusion coefficient.

"  The gravitational dual of $c$-extremization for a class of $(0,2)$ two-dimensional theories obtained by twisted compactifications of D3-brane gauge theories living at a toric Calabi-Yau three-fold has been recently proposed. The equivalence of this construction with $c$-extremization has been checked in various examples and holds also off-shell. In this note we prove that such equivalence holds for an arbitrary toric Calabi-Yau. We do it by generalizing the proof of the equivalence between $a$-maximization and volume minimization for four-dimensional toric quivers. By an explicit parameterization of the R-charges we map the trial right-moving central charge $c_r$ into the off-shell functional to be extremized in gravity. We also observe that the similar construction for M2-branes on $\mathbb{C}^4$ is equivalent to the $\mathcal{I}$-extremization principle that leads to the microscopic counting for the entropy of magnetically charged black holes in AdS$_4\times S^7$. Also this equivalence holds off-shell. ",high energy physics theory

"  Motivated by the appearance of fractional powers of line bundles in studies of vector-like spectra in 4d F-theory compactifications, we analyze the structure and origin of these bundles. Fractional powers of line bundles are also known as root bundles and can be thought of as generalizations of spin bundles. We explain how these root bundles are linked to inequivalent F-theory gauge potentials of a $G_4$-flux.   While this observation is interesting in its own right, it is particularly valuable for F-theory Standard Model constructions. In aiming for MSSMs, it is desired to argue for the absence of vector-like exotics. We work out the root bundle constraints on all matter curves in the largest class of currently-known F-theory Standard Model constructions without chiral exotics and gauge coupling unification. On each matter curve, we conduct a systematic ""bottom""-analysis of all solutions to the root bundle constraints and all spin bundles. Thereby, we derive a lower bound for the number of combinations of root bundles and spin bundles whose cohomologies satisfy the physical demand of absence of vector-like pairs.   On a technical level, this systematic study is achieved by a well-known diagrammatic description of root bundles on nodal curves. We extend this description by a counting procedure, which determines the cohomologies of so-called limit root bundles on full blow-ups of nodal curves. By use of deformation theory, these results constrain the vector-like spectra on the smooth matter curves in the actual F-theory geometry. ",high energy physics theory

Here we present optical and infrared imaging as well as integral field spectroscopy observations of FRB 20180916B with the WFC3 camera on the Hubble Space Telescope and the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. The 60-90 milliarcsecond (mas) resolution of the Hubble imaging, along with the previous 2.3-mas localization of FRB 20180916B, allow us to probe its environment with a 30-60 pc resolution. We constrain any point-like star-formation or HII region at the location of FRB 20180916B to have an H$\alpha$ luminosity $L_\mathrm{H\alpha} \lesssim 10^{37}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and, correspondingly, constrain the local star-formation rate to be $\lesssim10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The constraint on H$\alpha$ suggests that possible stellar companions to FRB 20180916B should be of a cooler, less massive spectral type than O6V. FRB 20180916B is 250 pc away (in projected distance) from the brightest pixel of the nearest young stellar clump, which is $\sim380$\,pc in size (full-width at half maximum).

"  We study large $N$ 2+1 dimensional fermions in the fundamental representation of an $SU(N)_k$ Chern Simons gauge group in the presence of a uniform background magnetic field for the $U(1)$ global symmetry of this theory. The magnetic field modifies the Schwinger Dyson equation for the propagator in an interesting way; the product between the self energy and the Greens function is replaced by a Moyal star product. Employing a basis of functions previously used in the study of non-commutative solitons, we are able to exactly solve the Schwinger Dyson equation and so determine the fermion propagator. The propagator has a series of poles (and no other singularities) whose locations yield a spectrum of single particle energies at arbitrary t' Hooft coupling and chemical potential. The usual free fermion Landau levels spectrum is shifted and broadened out; we compute the shifts and widths of these levels at arbitrary t'Hooft coupling. As a check on our results we independently solve for the propagators of the conjecturally dual theory of Chern Simons gauged large $N$ fundamental Wilson Fisher bosons also in a background magnetic field but this time only at zero chemical potential. The spectrum of single particle states of the bosonic theory precisely agrees with those of the fermionic theory under Bose-Fermi duality. ",high energy physics theory

It is found that the eigenspectrum of this network's Laplacian matrix, which is identified with Hamiltonians of the microstate system, has completely the same Nearest-Neighbor Spacing Distribution as that of general Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of Random Matrices. According to the BGS, i.e. Bohigas, Giannoni and Schmit conjecture, this forms evidence for chaotic features of the D1-D5 microstate dynamics. This evidence is further strengthened by observations that inverse of the first/minimal nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix is proportional to logarithms of the microstate number of the system. By Sekino and Susskind, this means that dynamics of the D1-D5 black hole microstates are not only chaotic, but also the fastest scrambler in nature. ",high energy physics theory
"  [Abridged] The study of disc kinematics has recently opened up as a promising method to detect unseen planets. However, a systematic, statistically meaningful analysis of such an approach remains missing. The aim of this work is to devise an automated, statistically robust technique to identify kinematical perturbations induced by the presence of planets in a gas disc, and to accurately infer their location. For this purpose, we produce hydro simulations of planet-disc interactions with different planet masses, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 $M_{Jup}$, at a radius of $R=100$ au in the disc, and perform radiative transfer calculations of CO to simulate observables for 13 planet azimuths. Using the DISCMINER package, we fit the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel emission to study line profile differences, including deviations from Keplerian rotation. The detection technique, based on line centroid differences, captures localised planet-driven perturbations, and can distinguish them from axisymmetric velocity perturbations. The method can detect all three simulated planets, at all azimuths, with an average accuracy of $\pm3^\circ$ in azimuth and $\pm8$ au in radius. Owing to disc structure and line-of-sight projection effects, planets at azimuths close to $\pm45^\circ$ yield the highest velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases, $0^\circ$ and $\pm90^\circ$, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities range within 40$-$70, 70$-$170 and 130$-$450 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 $M_{Jup}$ planets. Our analysis indicates that the variance of peak velocities is boosted near planets due to organised gas motions prompted by their localised gravitational well. We propose an approach that exploits this velocity coherence to provide, for the first time, statistically significant detections of localised planet-driven perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.

"  During migration cells exhibit a rich variety of seemingly random migration patterns, which makes unraveling the underlying mechanisms that control cell migration a daunting challenge. For efficient migration cells require a mechanism for polarization, so that traction forces are produced in the direction of motion, while adhesion is released to allow forward migration. To simplify the study of this process cells have been studied when placed along one-dimensional tracks, where single cells exhibit both smooth and stick-slip migration modes. The stick-slip motility mode is characterized by protrusive motion at the cell front, coupled with slow cell elongation, which is followed by rapid retractions of the cell back. In this study, we explore a minimal physical model that couples the force applied on the adhesion bonds to the length variations of the cell and the traction forces applied by the polarized actin retrograde flow. We show that the rich spectrum of cell migration patterns emerges from this model as different \emph{deterministic} dynamical phases. This result suggests a source for the large cell-to-cell variability (CCV) in cell migration patterns observed in single cells over time and within cell populations. The large heterogeneity can arise from small fluctuations in the cellular components that are greatly amplified due to moving the cells' internal state across the dynamical phase transition lines. Temporal noise is shown to drive random changes in the cellular polarization direction, which is enhanced during the stick-slip migration mode. These results offer a new framework to explain experimental observations of migrating cells, resulting from noisy switching between underlying deterministic migration modes. ",physics

"  We study the information quantities, including the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), mutual information (MI) and entanglement of purification (EoP), over Gubser-Rocha model. The remarkable property of this model is the zero entropy density at ground state, in term of which we expect to extract novel, even singular informational properties in zero temperature limit. Surprisedly, we do not observe any singular behavior of entanglement-related physical quantities under the zero temperature limit. Nevertheless, we find a peculiar property from Gubser-Rocha model that in low temperature region, the HEE decreases with the increase of temperature, which is contrary to that in most holographic models. We argue that this novel phenomenon is brought by the singular property of the zero temperature limit, of which the analytical verification is present. In addition, we also compare the features of the information quantities in Gubser-Rocha model with those in Reissner-Nordstrom Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole model. It is shown that the HEE and MI of Gubser-Rocha model are always larger than those of RN-AdS model, while the EoP behaves in an opposite way.

We show that on a large class of backgrounds its linearization agrees with general relativity. At the non-linear level, additional degrees of freedom appear, and we reveal the mechanism hiding them around the special backgrounds. We further argue that they do not contain a massive graviton, nor the Boulware-Deser ghost. The model thus propagates only one graviton, whereas the nature of the additional degrees of freedom remains to be investigated. We also present a foliation-preserving deformation of the model, which keeps all symmetries except time diffeomorphisms and has three degrees of freedom. ",high energy physics theory
"  Reconsidering the M2-brane solutions of d=11 supergravity with a transverse Englert flux introduced by one of us in 2016, we present a new purely group theoretical algorithm to solve Englert equation based on a specific embedding of the PSL(2,7) group into $\mathrm{Weyl[\mathfrak{e}_7]}$. The aforementioned embedding is singled out by the identification of $\mathrm{PSL(2,7)}$ with the automorphism group of the Fano plane. Relying on the revealed intrinsic PSL(2,7) symmetry of Englert equation and on the new algorithm we present an exhaustive classification of Englert fluxes. The residual supersymmetries of the corresponding M2-brane solutions associated with the first of the 8 classes into which we have partitioned Englert fluxes are exhaustively analyzed and we show that all residual d=3 supersymmetries with $\mathcal{N} \in \left\{1,2,3,4,5,6\right\}$ are available. Our constructions correspond to a particular case in the category of M2-brane solutions with transverse self-dual fluxes. ",high energy physics theory

Main focuses are on three themes, its various symmetry structures, their possible relevance to string/M theory, and a Hamilton-Jacobi like reformulation. We try to elucidate the basic ideas, most of which were rooted in more or less the same ground, and to explain motivations behind these works from a unified and vantage viewpoint. Various unsolved questions are mentioned. We also include some historical account on the genesis of the Nambu mechanics, and discuss (in the Appendix) some parallelism of various ideas behind the Nambu's paper with Dirac's old works which are related to the description of vortical flows in terms of gauge potentials.

"  Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers have gate errors and decoherence, limiting the depth of circuits that can be implemented on them. A strategy for NISQ algorithms is to reduce the circuit depth at the expense of increasing the qubit count. Here, we exploit this trade-off for an application called entanglement spectroscopy, where one computes the entanglement of a state $| \psi \rangle$ on systems $AB$ by evaluating the R\'enyi entropy of the reduced state $\rho_A = {\rm Tr}_B(| \psi \rangle \langle \psi |)$. For a $k$-qubit state $\rho(k)$, the R\'enyi entropy of order $n$ is computed via ${\rm Tr}(\rho(k)^{n})$, with the complexity growing exponentially in $k$ for classical computers. Johri, Steiger, and Troyer [PRB 96, 195136 (2017)] introduced a quantum algorithm that requires $n$ copies of $| \psi \rangle$ and whose depth scales linearly in $k*n$. Here, we present a quantum algorithm requiring twice the qubit resources ($2n$ copies of $| \psi \rangle$) but with a depth that is independent of both $k$ and $n$. Surprisingly this depth is only two gates. Our numerical simulations show that this short depth leads to an increased robustness to noise. ",quantum physics
"  Exoplanets orbiting pre-main sequence stars are laboratories for studying planet evolution processes, including atmospheric loss, orbital migration, and radiative cooling. V1298 Tau, a young solar analog with an age of 23 $\pm$ 4 Myr, is one such laboratory. The star is already known to host a Jupiter-sized planet on a 24 day orbit. Here, we report the discovery of three additional planets --- all between the size of Neptune and Saturn --- based on our analysis of K2 Campaign 4 photometry. Planets c and d have sizes of 5.6 and 6.4 $R_\oplus$, respectively and with orbital periods of 8.25 and 12.40 days reside 0.25% outside of the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Planet e is 8.7 $R_\oplus$ in size but only transited once in the K2 time series and thus has a period longer than 36 days, but likely shorter than 223 days. The V1298 Tau system may be a precursor to the compact multiplanet systems found to be common by the Kepler mission. However, the large planet sizes stand in sharp contrast to the vast majority of Kepler multis which have planets smaller than 3 $R_\oplus$. Simple dynamical arguments suggest total masses of $<$28 $M_\oplus$ and $<$120 $M_\oplus$ for the c-d and d-b planet pairs, respectively. The implied low masses suggest that the planets may still be radiatively cooling and contracting, and perhaps losing atmosphere. The V1298 Tau system offers rich prospects for further follow-up including atmospheric characterization by transmission or eclipse spectroscopy, dynamical characterization through transit-timing variations, and measurements of planet masses and obliquities by radial velocities.

"  Based on a large sample of 254 220 galaxies in 81 089 groups, which are selected from the spectroscopic galaxy sample of the SDSS DR12, we investigate the radial distribution of incidences, morphologies, environmental densities, and star formation properties of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies and star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the groups at z<0.2, as well as their changes with group richness ($N_{\rm rich}$). It is found that AGN fraction slightly declines with richness for the groups/clusters. The SFG fraction is on average about 2 times larger than the AGN fraction, with a significant declining trend with richness. The group AGNs are preferentially reside in spheroidal and bulge-dominated disc galaxies, whereas the majority of SFGs are late-type discs. Compared with the SFGs, the AGNs in poor groups ($5 \leqslant N_{\rm rich} \leqslant 10$) are closer to group center. The AGN fraction does not change with the distance to the group center, whereas the SFG fraction tends to be higher in the outskirts. The AGNs in groups have a higher incidence than the SFGs for the massive ($\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) > 10.7$) galaxies, and the mean SFG fraction is about 6 times as that of AGNs in the late-type galaxies with lower masses at larger radius. The distribution of environmental luminosity densities shows that the AGNs are likely to be reside in a denser environment relative to the SFGs. Compared with the SFGs in groups, the group AGNs are found to have a higher mean stellar mass, a lower mean star formation rate, and an older mean stellar age. ",astrophysics
"  In this paper, we introduce a new notion of convergence for the Laplace eigenfunctions in the semiclassical limit, the local weak convergence. This allows us to give a rigorous statement of Berry's random wave conjecture. Using recent results of Bourgain, Buckley and Wigman, we will prove that some deterministic families of eigenfunctions on $\mathbb{T}^2$ satisfy the conclusions of the random wave conjecture. We also show that on an arbitrary domain, a sequence of Laplace eigenfunctions always admits local weak limits. We explain why these local weak limits can be a powerful tool to study the asymptotic number of nodal domains. ",mathematics

A similar result is shown to hold assuming only amenability. ,mathematics
"  Linear polarization measurements in the optical band show polarization degrees of a few percent at late times. Recently, polarization at sub-percent level was also detected in radio by ALMA, opening the window for multi-wavelength polarimetry and stressing the importance of properly modeling polarization in GRB afterglows across the EM spectrum. We introduce a numerical tool that can calculate the polarization from relativistically moving surfaces by discretizing them to small patches of uniform magnetic field, calculating the polarized emission from each cell assuming synchrotron radiation and summing it to obtain the total degree of polarization. We apply this tool to afterglow shocks with random magnetic fields confined to the shock plane, considering electron radiative cooling. We analyze the observed polarization curves in several wavelengths above the cooling frequency and below the minimal synchrotron frequency and point to the characteristic differences between them. We present a method to constrain the jet opening angle and the viewing angle within the context of our model. Applying it to GRB 021004 we obtain angles of 10 and 8 degrees respectively and conclude that a non-negligible component of radial magnetic field is required to explain the 1% polarization level observed 3.5 days after the burst.

"  The Wahba problem, also known as rotation search, seeks to find the best rotation to align two sets of vector observations given putative correspondences, and is a fundamental routine in many computer vision and robotics applications. This work proposes the first polynomial-time certifiably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our first contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares (TLS) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the TLS cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). Since the resulting optimization is still highly non-convex and hard to solve globally, our third contribution is to develop a convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) relaxation. We show that while a naive relaxation performs poorly in general, our relaxation is tight even in the presence of large noise and outliers. We validate the proposed algorithm, named QUASAR (QUAternion-based Semidefinite relAxation for Robust alignment), in both synthetic and real datasets showing that the algorithm outperforms RANSAC, robust local optimization techniques, global outlier-removal procedures, and Branch-and-Bound methods. QUASAR is able to compute certifiably optimal solutions (i.e. the relaxation is exact) even in the case when 95% of the correspondences are outliers. ",mathematics

Here, we explore the potential of generative modeling to cheaply recreate small-scale storms by designing and implementing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that performs structural replication, dimensionality reduction, and clustering of high-resolution vertical velocity fields. Trained on ~6*10^6 samples spanning the globe, the VAE successfully reconstructs the spatial structure of convection, performs unsupervised clustering of convective organization regimes, and identifies anomalous storm activity, confirming the potential of generative modeling to power stochastic parameterizations of convection in climate models.

"  Social networks amplify inequalities due to fundamental mechanisms of social tie formation such as homophily and triadic closure. These forces sharpen social segregation reflected in network fragmentation. Yet, little is known about what structural factors facilitate fragmentation. In this paper we use big data from a widely-used online social network to demonstrate that there is a significant relationship between social network fragmentation and income inequality in cities and towns. We find that the organization of the physical urban space has a stronger relationship with fragmentation than unequal access to education, political segregation, or the presence of ethnic and religious minorities. Fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads and are relatively distant from the center of town. Towns in which amenities are spatially concentrated are also typically more socially segregated. These relationships suggest how urban planning may be a useful point of intervention to mitigate inequalities in the long run. ",physics

This analysis reveals the possibility of ultrafast, incoherent transduction and gain from a single photon signal to a strong coherent probe field. Homodyne detection of the displaced probe field enables a new method for room temperature, photon-number-resolving single photon detection.

"  We revisit the implications of Haag's theorem in the light of the renormalization group. There is still some lack of discussion in the literature about the possible impact of the theorem on the standard (as opposite of axiomatic) quantum field theory, and we try to shed light in this direction. Our discussion then deals with the interplay between Haag's theorem and renormalization. While we clarify how perturbative renormalization (for the sub-class of interactions that are renormalizable) marginalizes the its impact when the coupling is formally small, we argue that a non-perturbative and non-ambiguous renormalization cannot be built if there is any reference to the interaction picture with free fields. In other words, Haag's theorem should be regarded as a no-go theorem for the existence of a non-ambiguous analytic continuation from perturbative to non-perturbative QFT. ",high energy physics theory
"  The stellar density profile a galaxy is typically summarised with two numbers: total stellar mass and half-light radius. The total mass of a galaxy, however, is not a well-defined quantity, due to the finite depth of photometric observations and the arbitrariness of the distinction between galaxy and diffuse intra-group light. This limits our ability to make accurate comparisons between models and observations. I wish to provide a more robust two-parameter description of the stellar density distribution of elliptical galaxies, in terms of quantities that can be measured unambiguously. I propose to use the stellar mass enclosed within 10 kpc in projection, $M_{*,10}$, and the mass-weighted stellar density slope within the same aperture, $\Gamma_{*,10}$, for this purpose. I measured the distribution in $M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$ of a sample of elliptical galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, using photometry from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. The pair of values of $(M_{*,10},\Gamma_{*,10})$ can be used to predict the stellar density profile in the inner 10 kpc of a galaxy with better than 20% accuracy. Similarly, $M_{*,10}$ and $\Gamma_{*,10}$ can be combined to obtain a proxy for stellar velocity dispersion at least as good as the stellar mass fundamental plane. As a first application, I then compared the observed $M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation of elliptical galaxies with that of similarly selected galaxies in the EAGLE Reference simulation. Observed and simulated galaxies match at $M_{*,10}=10^{11}M_\odot$, but the EAGLE $M_{*,10}-\Gamma_{*,10}$ relation is shallower and has a larger intrinsic scatter compared to observations. This new parameterisation of the stellar density profile of massive elliptical galaxies provides a more robust way of comparing results from different photometric surveys and from hydrodynamical simulations.

"  The development of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems, where vehicle localization and tracking can be combined with vehicular communication, will lead to more efficient future vehicular networks. In this paper, we develop a predictive beamforming scheme in the context of DFRC systems. We consider a system model where the road-side units estimates and predicts the motion parameters of vehicles based on the echoes of the DFRC signal. Compared to the conventional feedback-based beam tracking approaches, the proposed method can reduce the signaling overhead and improve the accuracy. To accurately estimate the motion parameters of vehicles in real-time, we propose a novel message passing algorithm based on factor graph, which yields near optimal solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation. The beamformers are then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication links.}With the employment of appropriate approximations, all messages on the factor graph can be derived in a closed-form, thus reduce the complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed DFRC based beamforming scheme is superior to the feedback-based approach in terms of both estimation and communication performance. Moreover, the proposed message passing algorithm achieves a similar performance of the high-complexity particle-based methods. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Using a combinatorial argument, we prove the well-known result that the Wirtinger and Dehn presentations of a link in 3-space describe isomorphic groups. The result is not true for links $\ell$ in a thickened surface $S \times [0,1]$. Their precise relationship, as given in the 2012 thesis of R.E. Byrd, is established here by an elementary argument. When a diagram in $S$ for $\ell$ can be checkerboard shaded, the Dehn presentation leads naturally to an abelian ""Dehn coloring group,"" an isotopy invariant of $\ell$. Introducing homological information from $S$ produces a stronger invariant, $\cal C$, a module over the group ring of $H_1(S; {\mathbb Z})$. The authors previously defined the Laplacian modules ${\cal L}_G,{ \cal L}_{G^*}$ and polynomials $\Delta_G, \Delta_{G^*}$ associated to a Tait graph $G$ and its dual $G^*$, and showed that the pairs $\{{\cal L}_G, {\cal L}_{G^*}\}$, $\{\Delta_G, \Delta_{G^*}\}$ are isotopy invariants of $\ell$.

"  Tendon injuries like tendinopathies, full and partial thickness tears are prevalent, and the supraspinatus tendon (SST) is the most vulnerable ones in the rotator cuff. Early diagnosis of SST tendinopathies is of high importance and hard to achieve using ultrasound imaging. In this paper, an automatic tendinopathy recognition framework based on convolutional neural networks has been proposed to assist the diagnosis. This framework has two essential parts of tendon segmentation and classification. Tendon segmentation is done through a novel network, NASUNet, which follows an encoder-decoder architecture paradigm and utilizes a multi-scale Enlarging cell. Moreover, a general classification pipeline has been proposed for tendinopathy recognition, which supports different base models as the feature extractor engine. Two feature maps comprising positional information of the tendon region have been introduced as the network input to make the classification network spatial-aware. To evaluate the tendinopathy recognition system, a data set consisting of 100 SST ultrasound images have been acquired, in which tendinopathy cases are double-verified by magnetic resonance imaging. In both segmentation and classification tasks, lack of training data has been compensated by incorporating knowledge transferring, transfer learning, and data augmentation techniques. In cross-validation experiments, the proposed tendinopathy recognition model achieves 91% accuracy, 86.67% sensitivity, and 92.86% specificity, showing state-of-the-art performance against other models.

"  We present the observation and analysis of newly discovered coherent structures in the L1688 region of Ophiuchus and the B18 region of Taurus. Using data from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS), we identify regions of high density and near-constant, almost-thermal, velocity dispersion. Eighteen coherent structures are revealed, twelve in L1688 and six in B18, each of which shows a sharp ""transition to coherence"" in velocity dispersion around its periphery. The identification of these structures provides a chance to study the coherent structures in molecular clouds statistically. The identified coherent structures have a typical radius of 0.04 pc and a typical mass of 0.4 Msun, generally smaller than previously known coherent cores identified by Goodman et al. (1998), Caselli et al. (2002), and Pineda et al. (2010). We call these structures ""droplets."" We find that unlike previously known coherent cores, these structures are not virially bound by self-gravity and are instead predominantly confined by ambient pressure. The droplets have density profiles shallower than a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere, and they have a velocity (VLSR) distribution consistent with the dense gas motions traced by NH3 emission. These results point to a potential formation mechanism through pressure compression and turbulent processes in the dense gas. We present a comparison with a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a star-forming region, and we speculate on the relationship of droplets with larger, gravitationally bound coherent cores, as well as on the role that droplets and other coherent structures play in the star formation process.

"  In this paper, we investigate the combined effects of the cloud of strings and quintessence on the thermodynamics of a Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter black hole. Based on the equivalent thermodynamic quantities considering the correlation between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon, we extensively discuss the phase transitions of the space-time. Our analysis prove that similar to the case in AdS space-time, second-order phase transitions could take place under certain conditions, with the absence of first-order phase transition in the charged de Sitter black holes with cloud of string and quintessence. The effects of different thermodynamic quantities on the phase transitions are also quantitatively discussed, which provides a new approach to study the thermodynamic qualities of unstable dS space-time. Focusing on the entropy force generated by the interaction between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon, as well as the Lennard-Jones force between two particles, our results demonstrate the strong degeneracy between the entropy force of the two horizons and the ratio of the horizon positions, which follows the surprisingly similar law given the relation between the Lennard-Jones force and the ratio of two particle positions. Therefore, the study of the entropy force between two horizons, is not only beneficial to the deep exploration of the three modes of cosmic evolution, but also helpful to understand the correlation between the microstates of particles in black holes and those in ordinary thermodynamic systems.

"  A comprehensive understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) has been elusive due to the variety of questions surrounding the radiation mechanism at play in these events. Polarization measurements of GRBs can heavily constrain the relevant radiation mechanisms and the structure of the GRB jet; however, there is a limited number of theoretical predictions that observed GRB polarizations can be compared against. Here, we conduct radiative transfer calculations of a set of two dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic long GRB (LGRB) jet simulations, of a constant and a variable jet, using the Monte Carlo Radiation Transport (MCRaT) code. MCRaT has been enhanced by the inclusion of polarization; it has been first verified by reproducing a variety of results in the literature and then used to obtain the time integrated and resolved polarization degrees and angles of the synthetic LGRBs. While the obtained time-integrated polarization degrees {($\lesssim 1$\%)} are consistent with the constraints from the POLAR experiment, they are lower than other theoretical studies due to the lack of strong gradients in the model jet profiles that we use. The time resolved results suggests that GRBs with wide jets observed on axis will have small polarization degrees ($\lesssim 2\%$) and {constant polarization angles}, during the brightest portion of the light curve. GRBs observed off axis will have larger polarization degrees and polarization angles that change with the temporal structure of radiating shells in the outflow. We then place our results in the context of GRB prompt emission models and future LEAP and POLAR-2 GRB polarimetry detections. ",astrophysics

"  Some PARI programs have bringed out a property for the non-genus part of the class number of the imaginary quadratic fields, with respect to $(\sqrt D\,)^{\varepsilon}$, where $D$ is the absolute value of the discriminant and $\varepsilon \in ]0, 1[$, in relation with the $\varepsilon$-conjecture. The general Conjecture 3.1, restricted to quadratic fields, states that, for $\varepsilon \in ]0, 1[$, the successive maxima, as $D$ increases, of $\frac{H}{2^{N-1} \cdot (\sqrt D\,)^{\varepsilon}}$, where $H$ is the class number and $N$ the number of ramified primes, occur only for prime discriminants (i.e., $H$ odd); we perform computations giving some obviousness in the selected intervals. For degree $p>2$ cyclic fields, we define a ""mean value"" of the non-genus parts of the class numbers of the fields having the same conductor and obtain an analogous property on the successive maxima. In Theorem 2.5 we prove, under an assumption (true for $p=2, 3$), that the sequence of successive maxima of $\frac{H}{p^{N-1} \cdot (\sqrt D\,)^{\varepsilon}}$ is infinite. Finally we consider cyclic or non-cyclic abelian fields of degrees $4, 8, 6, 9, 10, 30$ to test the Conjecture 3.1. The successive maxima of $\frac{H}{(\sqrt D\,)^{\varepsilon}}$ are also analyzed.

"  The domain of allowed von Neumann entropies of a holographic field theory carves out a polyhedral cone -- the holographic entropy cone -- in entropy space. Such polyhedral cones are characterized by their extreme rays. For an arbitrary number of parties, it is known that the so-called perfect tensors are extreme rays. In this work, we constrain the form of the remaining extreme rays by showing that they correspond to geometries with vanishing mutual information between any two parties, ensuring the absence of Bell pair type entanglement between them. This is tantamount to proving that besides subadditivity, all non-redundant holographic entropy inequalities are superbalanced, i.e. not only do UV divergences cancel in the inequality itself (assuming smooth entangling surfaces), but also in the purification thereof.

"  Heavy particles in turbulent flows have been shown to accumulate in regions of high strain rate or low vorticity, a process otherwise known as preferential concentration. This can be observed in geophysical flows, and is inferred to occur in astrophysical environments, often resulting in rapid particle growth which is critical to physical processes such as rain or planet formation. Here we study the effects of preferential concentration in a two-way coupled system in the context of the particle-driven convective instability. To do so, we use Direct Numerical Simulations and adopt the two-fluid approximation. We focus on a particle size range for which the latter is valid, namely when the Stokes number is $\lesssim O(0.1)$. For Stokes number above $\sim 0.01$, we find that the maximum particle concentration enhancement over the mean scales with the rms fluid velocity $u_{\rm{rms}}$, the particle stopping time $\tau_p$, and the particle diffusivity $\kappa_p$, as $u_{\rm{rms}}^2 \tau_p / \kappa_p$. We show that this scaling can be understood from simple arguments of dominant balance. We also show that the typical particle concentration enhancement over the mean scales as $(u_{\rm{rms}}^2 \tau_p/ \kappa_p)^{1/2}$. We finally find that the probability distribution function of the particle concentration enhancement over the mean has an exponential tail whose slope scales as $(u_{\rm{rms}}^2 \tau_p / \kappa_p)^{-1/2}$. We apply our model to geophysical and astrophysical examples, and discuss its limitations. ",physics
"  The authors) Whenever light is slowed down, for any cause, two different formulas give its momentum. For dielectrics, the coexistence of those momenta was the heart of the century-old Abraham-Minkowski dilemma, recently resolved. We demonstrate that this framework extends to momentum exchange in wave-particle interaction; in particular to Langmuir waves for Landau damping and to vacuum waveguides of electron tubes (metallic slow-wave structures). Focussing on the latter, we show that the dilemma resolution is not limited to discriminating between kinematic and canonical momenta but also involves a non-negligible momentum flux from Maxwell's electromagnetic stress. The existence of two momenta in materials, plasmas, and waveguides, for which light velocity modification has entirely different origin, points to the universality of the Abraham-Minkowski dilemma.

We also confirm a recent conjecture that a discrete $S_N$ symmetry relating the baryons in the quiver theories is in fact gauged. ",high energy physics theory
"  In this paper, we propose multi-input multi-output (MIMO) beamforming designs towards joint radar sensing and multi-user communications. We employ the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as a performance metric of target estimation, under both point and extended target scenarios. We then propose minimizing the CRB of radar sensing while guaranteeing a pre-defined level of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each communication user. For the single-user scenario, we derive a closed form for the optimal solution for both cases of point and extended targets. For the multi-user scenario, we show that both problems can be relaxed into semidefinite programming by using the semidefinite relaxation approach, and prove that the global optimum can always be obtained. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the globally optimal solutions are reachable via the proposed methods, which provide significant gains in target estimation performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

"  Using the background field method for the functional renormalization group approach in the case of a generic gauge theory, we study the background field symmetry and gauge dependence of the background average effective action, when the regulator action depends on external fields. The final result is that the symmetry of the average effective action can be maintained for a wide class of regulator functions, but in all cases the dependence of the gauge fixing remains on-shell. The Yang-Mills theory is considered as the main particular example. ",high energy physics theory

We extract the density of states and hence entropy from BTZ partition function via inverse Laplace transform. Then the one-loop Witten diagram is computed in the $p$-adic BTZ black hole background, yielding constraints on the heavy-heavy-light averaged three-point coefficient of its boundary $p$-adic CFT.

"  The large capacity and robustness of information encoding in the temporal mode of photons is important in quantum information processing, in which characterizing temporal quantum states with high usability and time resolution is essential. We propose and demonstrate a direct measurement method of temporal complex wavefunctions for weak light at a single-photon level with subpicosecond time resolution. Our direct measurement is realized by ultrafast metrology of the interference between the light under test and self-generated monochromatic reference light; no external reference light or complicated post-processing algorithms are required. Hence, this method is versatile and potentially widely applicable for temporal state characterization. ",quantum physics
"  We contrast the dynamics of the Horava theory with anisotropic Weyl symmetry with the case when this symmetry is explicitly broken, which is called the kinetic-conformal Horava theory. To do so we perform the canonical formulation of the anisotropic conformal theory at the classical level with a general conformal potential. Both theories have the generator of the anisotropic Weyl transformations as a constraint but it changes from first to second-class when the Weyl symmetry is broken. The FDiff-covariant vector a_i = \partial_i \ln N plays the role of gauge connection for the anisotropic Weyl transformations. A Lagrange multiplier plays also the role of gauge connection, being the time component. The anisotropic conformal theory propagates the same number of degrees of freedom of the kinetic-conformal theory, which in turn are the same of General Relativity. This is due to exchange of a second-class constraint in the kinetic-conformal case by a gauge symmetry in the anisotropic conformal case. An exception occurs if the conformal potential does not depend on the lapse function N, as is the case of the so called Cotton^2 potential, in which case one of the physical modes becomes odd. We develop in detail two explicit anisotropic conformal models. One of them depends on N whereas the other one is the Cotton^2 model. We also study conformally flat solutions in the anisotropic conformal and the kinetic-conformal theories, defining as conformally flat the spatial metric, but leaving for N a form different to the one dictated by the anisotropic Weyl transformations. We find that in both theories these configurations have vanishing canonical momentum and they are critical points of the potential. In the kinetic-conformal theory we find explicitly an exact, nontrivial, conformally flat solution. ",high energy physics theory
"  The purpose of this report is to look at the measures of importance of components in systems in terms of reliability. In the first work of Birnbaum (1968) on this subject, many interesting studies were created and important indicators were constructed that allowed to organize the components of complex systems. They are helpful in analyzing the reliability of the designed systems, establishing the principles of operation and maintenance. The significance measures presented here are collected and discussed regarding the motivation behind their creation. They concern an approach in which both elements and systems are binary, and the possibility of generalization to multistate systems is only mentioned. Among the discussed is one new proposal using the methods of game theory, combining the sensitivity to the structure of the system and the operational effects on the system performance. The presented severity measures use a knowledge of the system structure as well as reliability and wear and tear, and whether the components can be repaired and maintained.

"  Several versions of quantum theory assume some form of localized collapse. If measurement outcomes are indeed defined by localized collapses, then a loophole-free demonstration of Bell non-locality needs to ensure space-like separated collapses associated with the measurements of the entangled systems. This collapse locality loophole remains largely untested, with one significant exception probing Diosi's and Penrose's gravitationally induced collapse hypotheses. I describe here techniques that allow much stronger experimental tests. These apply to all the well known types of collapse postulate, including gravitationally induced collapse, spontaneous localization models and Wigner's consciousness-induced collapse.

"  Transfer learning and joint learning approaches are extensively used to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In medical imaging applications in which the target dataset is typically very small, transfer learning improves feature learning while joint learning has shown effectiveness in improving the network's generalization and robustness. In this work, we study the combination of these two approaches for the problem of liver lesion segmentation and classification. For this purpose, 332 abdominal CT slices containing lesion segmentation and classification of three lesion types are evaluated. For feature learning, the dataset of MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge is used. Joint learning shows improvement in both segmentation and classification results.

"  Increasing the penetration of variable generation has a substantial effect on the operational reliability of power systems. The higher level of uncertainty that stems from this variability makes it more difficult to determine whether a given operating condition will be secure or insecure. Data-driven techniques provide a promising way to identify security rules that can be embedded in economic dispatch model to keep power system operating states secure. This paper proposes using a sparse weighted oblique decision tree to learn accurate, understandable, and embeddable security rules that are linear and can be extracted as sparse matrices using a recursive algorithm. These matrices can then be easily embedded as security constraints in power system economic dispatch calculations using the Big-M method. Tests on several large datasets with high renewable energy penetration demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the sparse weighted oblique decision tree outperforms the state-of-art weighted oblique decision tree while keeping the security rules simple. When embedded in the economic dispatch, these rules significantly increase the percentage of secure states and reduce the average solution time. ",electrical engineering and systems science

We show multiple example use cases (including a total variation variant), demonstrate synergy between it and other regularizers, and propose an algorithm to efficiently solve problems regularized or constrained by the proposed penalty.

"  We report on the Insight-HXMT observations of the new black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst. Detailed spectral analysis via the continuum fitting method shows an evolution of the inferred spin during its high soft sate. Moreover, the hardness ratio, the non-thermal luminosity and the reflection fraction also undergo an evolution, exactly coincident to the period when the inferred spin transition takes place. The unphysical evolution of the spin is attributed to the evolution of the inner disc, which is caused by the collapse of a hot corona due to condensation mechanism or may be related to the deceleration of a jet-like corona. The studies of the inner disc radius and the relation between the disc luminosity and the inner disc radius suggest that, only at a particular epoch, did the inner edge of the disc reach the innermost stable circular orbit and the spin measurement is reliable. We then constrain the spin of MAXI J1820+070 to be a*=0.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}. Such a slowly spinning black hole possessing a strong jet suggests that its jet activity is driven mainly by the accretion disc rather than by the black hole spin. ",astrophysics
"  In 2006, Fock and Goncharov constructed a nice basis of the ring of regular functions on the moduli space of framed ${\rm PGL}_2$-local systems on a punctured surface $S$. The moduli space is birational to a cluster $\mathcal{X}$-variety, whose positive real points recover the enhanced Teichm\""uller space of $S$. Their basis is enumerated by integral laminations on $S$, which are collections of closed curves in $S$ with integer weights. Around ten years later, a quantized version of this basis, still enumerated by integral laminations, was constructed by Allegretti and Kim. For each choice of an ideal triangulation of $S$, each quantum basis element is a Laurent polynomial in the exponential of quantum shear coordinates for edges of the triangulation, with coefficients being Laurent polynomials in $q$ with integer coefficients. We show that these coefficients are Laurent polynomials in $q$ with positive integer coefficients. Our result was expected in a positivity conjecture for framed protected spin characters in physics and provides a rigorous proof of it, and may also lead to other positivity results, as well as categorification. A key step in our proof is to solve a purely topological and combinatorial ordering problem about an ideal triangulation and a closed curve on $S$. For this problem we introduce a certain graph on $S$, which is interesting in its own right. ",mathematics
"  We formulate Witten index problems for theories with two supercharges in a Majorana doublet, as in $d=3$ $\mathcal N=1$ theories and dimensional reduction thereof. Regardless of spacetime dimensions, the wall-crossing occurs generically, in the parameter space of the real superpotential $W$. With scalar multiplets only, the path integral reduces to a Gaussian one in terms of $dW$, with a winding number interpretation, and allows an in-depth study of the wall-crossing. After discussing the connection to well-known mathematical approaches such as the Morse theory, we move on to Abelian gauge theories. Even though the index theorem for the latter is a little more involved, we again reduce it to winding number countings of the neutral part of $dW$. The holonomy saddle plays key roles for both dimensions and also in relating indices across dimensions. ",high energy physics theory

The aim of this paper is to prove that the sheaf versions of the functors of blown-up intersection cochains are realizations of Deligne's sheaves. This proves that Deligne's sheaves can be incarnated at the level of complexes of sheaves by soft sheaves of perverse differential graded algebras. We also study Poincar\'e and Verdier dualities of blown-up intersections sheaves with the use of Borel-Moore chains of intersection. ,mathematics

"  Out-of-time-order correlators (OTOC), vigorously being explored as a measure of quantum chaos and information scrambling, is studied here in the natural and simplest multi-particle context of bipartite systems. We show that two strongly chaotic and weakly interacting subsystems display two distinct phases in the growth of OTOC.The first is dominated by intra-subsystem scrambling, when an exponential growth with a positive Lyapunov exponent is observed till the Ehrenfest time. This phase is essentially independent of the interaction, while the second phase is an interaction dominated exponential approach to saturation that is universal and described by a random matrix model. This simple random matrix model of weakly interacting strongly chaotic bipartite systems, previously employed for studying entanglement and spectral transitions, is approximately analytically solvable for its OTOC. The example of two coupled kicked rotors is used to demonstrate the two phases, and the extent to which the random matrix model is applicable. That the two phases correspond to delocalization in the subsystems followed by inter-subsystem mixing is seen via the participation ratio in phase-space. We also point out that the second, universal, phase alone exists when the observables are in a sense already scrambled. Thus, while the post-Ehrenfest time OTOC growth is in general not well-understood, the case of strongly chaotic and weakly coupled systems presents an, perhaps important, exception. ",quantum physics

In our modest sample we see no evidence for bimodality in the pulse width distribution. We also identify five FRBs with evidence of millisecond timescale pulse broadening caused by scattering in inhomogeneous plasma. We find no evidence for a relationship between pulse broadening and extragalactic dispersion measure. The scattering could be either caused by extreme turbulence in the host galaxy or chance propagation through foreground galaxies. With future high time resolution observations and detailed study of host galaxy properties we may be able to probe line-of-sight turbulence on gigaparsec scales. ",astrophysics
"  All Italian consonants affected by gemination, that is affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals, and stops, were analyzed within a project named GEMMA that lasted over a span of about 25 years. Results of the analysis on stops, as published in (Esposito, A., and Di Benedetto, M. G. (1999). ""Acoustic and Perceptual Study of Gemination in Italian Stops,"" The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, ASA, Vol. 30, pp. 175-185) showed that the main acoustic cue to gemination in Italian was closure duration, while frequency and energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by gemination. This paper - the first of a set of two covering all remaining consonants - addresses nasals and liquids; its companion paper addresses affricates and fricatives. Results on nasals and liquids confirm the findings on stops, in particular that the primary acoustic cue to gemination in Italian is durational in nature and corresponds to a lengthened consonant duration. Results also show an inverse correlation between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations which is, however, also present when considering singleton vs. geminate word sets separately, indicating a sort of duration compensation between these segments to eventually preserve rhythmical structures; this inverse correlation is reinforced when considering singleton and geminate sets combined. Classification tests of singleton vs. geminate consonants show that, for both nasals and liquids, best classification scores are obtained when consonant duration is used as a classification parameter. Although slightly less performing, the ratio between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations is also a potential good candidate for automatic classification of geminate vs singleton nasals and liquids in Italian.

"  The research challenge of current Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to design energy-efficient, low-cost, high-accuracy, self-healing, and scalable systems for applications such as environmental monitoring. Traditional WSNs consist of low density, power-hungry digital motes that are expensive and cannot remain functional for long periods on a single power charge. In order to address these challenges, a dumb-sensing and smart-processing architecture that splits sensing and computation capabilities is proposed. Sensing is exclusively the responsibility of analog substrate---consisting of low-power, low-cost all-analog sensors---that sits beneath the traditional WSN comprising of digital nodes, which does all the processing of the sensor data received from analog sensors. A low-power and low-cost solution for substrate sensors has been proposed using Analog Joint Source Channel Coding (AJSCC) realized via the characteristics of Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET). Digital nodes (receiver) also estimate the source distribution at the analog sensors (transmitter) using machine learning techniques so as to find the optimal parameters of AJSCC that are communicated back to the analog sensors to adapt their sensing resolution as per the application needs. The proposed techniques have been validated via simulations from MATLAB and LTSpice to show promising performance and indeed prove that our framework can support large scale high density and persistent WSN deployment.

"  Extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) are an emerging class of blazars. Their typical two-hump structured spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks at higher energies with respect to conventional blazars. Multi-wavelength (MWL) observations constrain their synchrotron peak in the medium to hard X-ray band. Their gamma-ray SED peaks above the GeV band, and in some objects it extends up to several TeV. Up to now, only a few EHBLs have been detected in the TeV gamma-ray range. In this paper, we report the detection of the EHBL 2WHSP J073326.7+515354, observed and detected during 2018 in TeV gamma rays with the MAGIC telescopes. The broad-band SED is studied within a MWL context, including an analysis of the Fermi-LAT data over ten years of observation and with simultaneous Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and KVA data. Our analysis results in a set of spectral parameters that confirms the classification of the source as an EHBL. In order to investigate the physical nature of this extreme emission, different theoretical frameworks were tested to model the broad-band SED. The hard TeV spectrum of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 sets the SED far from the energy equipartition regime in the standard one-zone leptonic scenario of blazar emission. Conversely, more complex models of the jet, represented by either a two-zone spine-layer model or a hadronic emission model, better represent the broad-band SED. ",astrophysics

Here, we consider a silicon spherical nanoparticle on a dielectric one-layered substrate. At the normal incidence of light, the layer thickness controls the contribution of the nanoparticle's electric and magnetic multipoles to the subsequent optical response. We show that changing the polarization of incident light at a specific excitation angle and layer thickness leads to switching between the multipoles.

"  We investigate whether the tentative correlation between planets and debris discs which has been previously identified can be confirmed at high significance. We compile a sample of 201 stars with known planets and existing far infrared observations. The sample is larger than those studied previously since we include targets from an unpublished Herschel survey of planet hosts. We use spectral energy distribution modelling to characterise Kuiper belt analogue debris discs within the sample, then compare the properties of the discs against a control sample of 294 stars without known planets. Survival analysis suggests that there is a significant ($p\sim 0.002$) difference between the disc fractional luminosity distributions of the two samples. However, this is largely a result of the fact that the control sample contains a higher proportion of close binaries and of later-type stars; both of these factors are known to reduce disc detection rates. Considering only Sun-like stars without close binary companions in each sample greatly reduces the significance of the difference ($p\sim 0.3$). We also find no evidence for a difference in the disc fractional luminosities of stars hosting planets more or less massive than Saturn ($p\sim 0.9$). Finally, we find that the planet hosts have cooler discs than the control stars, but this is likely a detection bias, since the warmest discs in the control sample are also the faintest, and would thus be undetectable around the more distant planet hosts. Considering only discs in each sample that could have been detected around a typical planet host, we find $p\sim 0.07$ for the temperatures. ",astrophysics
"  We study the boundary value problem of two stationary BGK-type models - the BGK model for fast chemical reaction and the BGK model for slow chemical reaction - and provide a unified argument to establish the existence and uniqueness of stationary flows of reactive BGK models in a slab. For both models, the main difficulty arises in the uniform control of the reactive parameters from above and below, since, unlike the BGK models for non-reactive gases, the reactive parameters for the reactive BGK models are defined through highly nonlinear relations. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce several nonlinear functionals that capture essential structures of such nonlinear relations such as the monotonicity in specific variables, that enable one to derive necessary estimates for the reactive equilibrium coefficients.

"  Societal biases are a major issue in school students' access to and interaction with science. Schools engagement programmes in science from universities, like independent research projects, which could try and tackle these problems are, however, often inequitable. We evaluate these concerns applied to one such programme, `Physics Research in School Environments' (PRiSE), which features projects in space science, astronomy, and particle physics. Comparing the schools involved with PRiSE to those of other similar schemes and UK national statistics, we find that PRiSE has engaged a much more diverse set of schools with significantly more disadvantaged groups than is typical. While drop-off occurs within the protracted programme, we find no evidence of systematic biases present. The majority of schools that complete projects return for multiple years of the programme, with this repeated buy-in from schools again being unpatterned by typical societal inequalities. Therefore, schools' ability to succeed at independent research projects appears independent of background within the PRiSE framework. Qualitative feedback from teachers show that the diversity and equity of the programme, which they attribute to the level of support offered through PRiSE's framework, is valued and they have highlighted further ways of making the projects potentially even more accessible. Researcher-involvement, uncommon in many other programmes, along with teacher engagement and communication are found to be key elements to success in independent research projects overall. ",physics
"  Adaptive control approaches yield high-performance controllers when a precise system model or suitable parametrizations of the controller are available. Existing data-driven approaches for adaptive control mostly augment standard model-based methods with additional information about uncertainties in the dynamics or about disturbances. In this work, we propose a purely data-driven, model-free approach for adaptive control. Tuning low-level controllers based solely on system data raises concerns on the underlying algorithm safety and computational performance. Thus, our approach builds on GoOSE, an algorithm for safe and sample-efficient Bayesian optimization. We introduce several computational and algorithmic modifications in GoOSE that enable its practical use on a rotational motion system. We numerically demonstrate for several types of disturbances that our approach is sample efficient, outperforms constrained Bayesian optimization in terms of safety, and achieves the performance optima computed by grid evaluation. We further demonstrate the proposed adaptive control approach experimentally on a rotational motion system. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Three dimensional supersymmetric field theories have large moduli spaces of circular Wilson loops preserving a fixed set of supercharges. We simplify previous constructions of such Wilson loops and amend and clarify their classification. For a generic quiver gauge theory we identify the moduli space as a quotient of $C^m$ for some $m$ by an appropriate symmetry group. These spaces are quiver varieties associated to a cover of the original quiver or a subquiver thereof. This moduli space is generically singular and at the singularities there are large degeneracies of operators which seem different, but whose expectation values and correlation functions with all other gauge invariant operators are identical. The formulation presented here, where the Wilson loops are on $S^3$ or squashed $S^3_b$ also allows to directly implement a localization procedure on these observables, which previously required an indirect cohomological equivalence argument.

"  We study generating functions of ordinary and plane partitions coloured by the action of a finite subgroup of the corresponding special linear group. After reviewing known results for the case of ordinary partitions, we formulate a conjecture concerning a factorisation property of the generating function of coloured plane partitions that can be thought of as an orbifold analogue of a conjecture of Maulik et al., now a theorem, in three-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas theory. We study natural quantisations of the generating functions arising from geometry, discuss a quantised version of our conjecture, and prove a positivity result for the quantised coloured plane partition function under a geometric assumption.

"  We consider the effects of weak gravitational lensing on observations of 196 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) from years 1 to 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We simultaneously measure both the angular correlation function and the non-Gaussian skewness caused by weak lensing. This approach has the advantage of being insensitive to the intrinsic dispersion of SNe Ia magnitudes. We model the amplitude of both effects as a function of $\sigma_8$, and find $\sigma_8 = 1.2^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$. We also apply our method to a subsample of 488 SNe from the Joint Light-curve Analysis (JLA) (chosen to match the redshift range we use for this work), and find $\sigma_8 = 0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.7}$. The comparable uncertainty in $\sigma_8$ between DES-SN and the larger number of SNe from JLA highlights the benefits of homogeneity of the DES-SN sample, and improvements in the calibration and data analysis.

"  We present a new way to mitigate focal-ratio degradation (FRD) when using optical fibers to transport multimode light. Our approach exploits a custom multicore fiber (MCF) with six dissimilar cores that are single mode at ~1550 nm wavelength and minimally coupled over 7 m. We fabricated adiabatic mode-selective photonic lanterns (PLs) at each end of the MCF to create a fiber link with multimode ports, the PLs coupling each spatial mode of the multimode ports to a specific core of the MCF and vice versa. The PL-MCF-PL link exhibits superior FRD behavior compared to a conventional multimode fiber that also supports 6 modes, because it inhibits the transfer of light from lower-order modes to higher-order modes. These results open up a potentially powerful new approach to mitigate FRD in multimode fiber links, with particular applications in astronomical instruments. ",physics
"  In this paper, we report a polarimetry-based THz imaging technique that highly benefits from backscatter data reflected from PEC hidden objects, considering the edge diffractions of the object as a key point. First, based on physical optic principles, we investigate the cross-polarized reflections of PEC objects in order to show the superiority of reflections of the edges to other parts of the object. Next, we represent the results of a near filed simulation using Feko to study the differences between cross and co-polarized reflections of a PEC object and the human body beneath it. To a further illustration, our experimental results are presented in which we utilized a THz imaging system consisting of a semiconductor-based THz camera and a horn antenna operating at 100 GHz as the source. Cross-polarized backscatter data is analyzed to distinguish PEC objects from the human body. Besides, we used two orthogonal linear polarizations of the source to maximize backscattering from orthogonal edges. Experimental results show a noticeable improvement in edge detection of hidden objects indicating that this method can result in high accuracy in THz real-time imaging. ",physics
"  A single-photon CMOS image sensor design based on pinned photodiode (PPD) with multiple charge transfers and sampling is described. In the proposed pixel architecture, the photogenerated signal is sampled non-destructively multiple times and the results are averaged. Each signal measurement is statistically independent and by averaging the electronic readout noise is reduced to a level where single photons can be distinguished reliably. A pixel design using this method has been simulated in TCAD and several layouts have been generated for a 180 nm CMOS image sensor process. Using simulations, the noise performance of the pixel has been determined as a function of the number of samples, sense node capacitance, sampling rate, and transistor characteristics. The strengths and the limitations of the proposed design are discussed in detail, including the trade-off between noise performance and readout rate and the impact of charge transfer inefficiency. The projected performance of our first prototype device indicates that single-photon imaging is within reach and could enable ground-breaking performance in many scientific and industrial imaging applications.

"  In this paper, we study distributed channel triggering mechanisms for wireless networked control systems (WNCSs) for conventional and smart sensors, i.e., sensors without and with computational power, respectively. We first consider the case of conventional sensors in which the state estimate is performed based on the intermittent raw measurements received from the sensor and we show that the priority measure is associated with the statistical properties of the observations, as it is the case of the cost of information loss (CoIL) [1]. Next, we consider the case of smart sensors and despite the fact that CoIL can also be deployed, we deduce that it is more beneficial to use the available measurements and we propose a function of the value of information (VoI) [2], [3] that also incorporates the channel conditions as the priority measure. The different scenarios and priority measures are discussed and compared for simple scenarios via simulations. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Consistency and stability properties of the method are studied. We choose to improve the accuracy of the computed solution via a mesh refinement based on Richardson's extrapolation. Comparisons with some proposed methods for the American options problem are carried out to validate the obtained numerical results and to show the efficiency of the proposed numerical methods. Finally, by \textit{a posteriori} error estimator, we find a suitable computational grid requiring that the computed solution verifies a prefixed tolerance. ",mathematics
"  For each positive integer $n$, we give a geometric description of the stably trivial elements of the group $\pi_n U_n/O_n$. In particular, we show that all such elements admit representatives whose tangencies with respect to a fixed Lagrangian plane consist only of folds. By the h-principle for the simplification of caustics, this has the following consequence: if a Lagrangian distribution is stably trivial from the viewpoint of a Lagrangian homotopy sphere, then by an ambient Hamiltonian isotopy one may deform the Lagrangian homotopy sphere so that its tangencies with respect to the Lagrangian distribution are only of fold type. Thus the stable triviality of the Lagrangian distribution, which is a necessary condition for the simplification of caustics to be possible, is also sufficient. We give applications of this result to the arborealization program and to the study of nearby Lagrangian homotopy spheres. ",mathematics
"  The Bayesian isochrone fitting using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is applied, to derive the probability distribution of the parameters age, metallicity, reddening, and absolute distance modulus. We introduce the \texttt{SIRIUS} code by means of simulated color-magnitude diagrams, including the analysis of multiple stellar populations. The population tagging is applied from the red giant branch to the bottom of the main sequence. Through sanity checks using synthetic {\it HST} color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters we verify the code reliability in the context of simple and multiple stellar populations. In such tests, the formal uncertainties in age or age difference, metallicity, reddening, and absolute distance modulus can reach $400$ Myr, $0.03$ dex, $0.01$ mag, and $0.03$ mag, respectively. We apply the method to analyse NGC 6752, using Dartmouth stellar evolutionary models. Assuming a single stellar population, we derive an age of $13.7\pm0.5$ Gyr and a distance of $d_{\odot}=4.11\pm 0.08$ kpc, with the latter in agreement within $~3\sigma$ with the inverse Gaia parallax. In the analysis of the multiple stellar populations, three {populations} are clearly identified. From the Chromosome Map and UV/Optical two-color diagrams inspection, we found a fraction of stars of $25\pm5$, $46\pm7$, and $29\pm5$ per cent, for the first, second, and third generations, respectively. These fractions are in good agreement with the literature. An age difference of $500\pm410$ Myr between the first and the third generation is found, with the uncertainty decreasing to $400$ Myr when the helium enhancement is taken into account.

"  As the number of known exoplanets has climbed into the thousands, efforts by theorists to understand the diversity of climates that may exist on terrestrial planets in the habitable zone have also accelerated. These efforts have ranged from analytical, to simple 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D models, to highly-sophisticated 3D global climate models (GCMs) adapted from Earth climate and weather models. The advantage of the latter is that fewer physical processes are reduced to simple parameterizations and empirical fits, and may instead be represented by physically-motivated algorithms. However, many such models are difficult to use, and take a long time to reach a converged state relative to simpler models, thereby limiting the amount of parameter space that can be explored. We use PlaSim, a 3D climate model of intermediate complexity, to bridge this gap, allowing us to produce hundreds to thousands of model outputs that have reached energy balance equilibrium at the surface and top of the atmosphere. We are making our model outputs available to the community in a permanent Dataverse repository (https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/kmenou). A subset of our model outputs can be used directly with external spectral postprocessing tools, and we have used them with petitRADTRANS and SBDART in order to create synthetic observables representative of fully-3D climates. Another natural use of this repository will be to use more-sophisticated GCMs to cross-check and verify PlaSim's results, and to explore in more detail those regions of the exoplanet parameter space identified in our PlaSim results as being of particular interest. We will continue to add models to this repository in the future, including more than 1000 models in the short- to medium-term future, expanding the diversity of climates represented therein.

"  We examine two aspects of the mathematical basis for two-tier voting systems, such as that of the Council of the European Union. These aspects concern the use of square-root weights and the choice of quota.   Square-root weights originate in the Penrose square-root system, which assumes that votes are cast independently and uniformly at random, and is based around the concept of equality of influence of the voters across the Union. There are (at least) two distinct definitions of influence in current use in probability theory, namely, absolute and conditional influence. These are in agreement when the underlying random variables are independent, but not generally. We review their possible implications for two-tier voting systems, especially in the context of the so-called collective bias model. We show that the two square-root laws invoked by Penrose are unified through the use of conditional influence.   In an elaboration of the square-root system, Slomczynski and Zyczkowski have proposed an exact value for the quota $q=q^*$ to be achieved in a successful vote of a two-tier system, and they have presented numerical and theoretical evidence in its support. We indicate some numerical and mathematical issues arising in the use of a Gaussian (or normal) approximation in this context, and we propose that other values of $q$ may be as good if not better than $q^*$. We discuss certain aspects of the relationship between theoreticians and politicians in the design of a two-tier voting system, and we reach the conclusion that the choice of quota in the square-root system is an issue for politicians informed by theory.

"  In the homomorphism order of digraphs, a duality pair is an ordered pair of digraphs $(G,H)$ such that for any digraph, $D$, $G\to D$ if and only if $D\not\to H$. The directed path on $k+1$ vertices together with the transitive tournament on $k$ vertices is a classic example of a duality pair. This relation between paths and tournaments implies that a graph is $k$-colourable if and only if it admits an orientation with no directed path on more than $k$-vertices.   In this work, for every undirected cycle $C$ we find an orientation $C_D$ and an oriented path $P_C$, such that $(P_C,C_D)$ is a duality pair. As a consequence we obtain that there is a finite set, $F_C$, such that an undirected graph is homomorphic to $C$, if and only if it admits an $F_C$-free orientation. As a byproduct of the proposed duality pairs, we show that if $T$ is a tree of height at most $3$, one can choose a dual of $T$ of linear size with respect to the size of $T$. ",mathematics

We calculate the minimal surfaces of the corresponding probing open string world-sheet in anisotropic backgrounds with various temperatures and chemical potentials. The dynamical wall (DW) locations, providing the quark confinement, depend on the orientation of the quark pairs, that gives a crossover transition between confinement/deconfinement phases in the dual gauge theory.

We prove the existence of additive size bias for the one-sided case of tempered stable distributions, in particular, the gamma distribution. We also show that the Stein characterization for the convolution of independent tempered stable distributions can be derived from its characteristic function. Finally, we derive an error bound for tempered stable approximation. ",mathematics
  The underlying hypothesis of this work is that the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are wormhole mouths rather than supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Under some - quite general - assumptions such wormholes may emit gamma radiation as a result of a collision of accreting flows inside the wormholes. This radiation has a distinctive spectrum much different from those of jets or accretion disks of AGNs. An observation of such radiation would serve as evidence of the existence of wormholes. ,astrophysics

"  We developed a low emittance electron storage ring with large 6D dynamic aperture. Contrary to the traditional approach using strong focusing magnetic cells with optimized (and large) horizontal phase advance, which yields huge natural chromaticity, we employed a relatively weak focusing lattice with low chromaticity per cell and, consequently, wide on- and off-momentum dynamic aperture. Inevitable for weak focusing emittance growth, we compensated by slicing the lattice into many short, with small bending angle, elementary periodic cells. To reduce the size, we superimposed focusing gradient and chromaticity compensating sextupole components over the dipole field utilizing superconducting magnets based on the Canted Cosine Theta (CCT) winding technology. The result is a model lattice with 50 pm horizontal emittance at 3 GeV beam energy, with 400-500 m circumference and large 6D aperture. ",physics
"  A topological order is a new quantum phase that is beyond Landau's symmetry-breaking paradigm. Its defining features include robust degenerate ground states, long-range entanglement and anyons. It was known that $R$- and $F$-matrices, which characterize the fusion-braiding properties of anyons, can be used to uniquely identify topological order. In this article, we explore an essential question: how can the $R$- and $F$-matrices be experimentally measured? By using quantum simulations based on a toric code model with boundaries and state-of-the-art technology, we show that the braidings, i.e. the $R$-matrices, can be completely determined by the half braidings of boundary excitations due to the boundary-bulk duality and the anyon condensation. The $F$-matrices can also be measured in a scattering quantum circuit involving the fusion of three anyons in two different orders. Thus we provide an experimental protocol for measuring the unique identifiers of topological order. ",quantum physics

While in low-dimension the problem was extensively studied, manifold repairing in high dimension is still an open problem.

"  A vertex-transitive map $X$ is a map on a surface on which the automorphism group of $X$ acts transitively on the set of vertices of $X$. If the face-cycles at all the vertices in a map are of same type then the map is called a semi-equivelar map. Clearly, a vertex-transitive map is semi-equivelar. Converse of this is not true in general. In particular, there are semi-equivelar maps on the torus, on the Klein bottle and on the surfaces of Euler characteristics $-1$ $\&$ $-2$ which are not vertex-transitive.   It is known that the boundaries of Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, regular prisms and antiprisms are vertex-transitive maps on $\mathbb{S}^2$. Here we show that there is exactly one semi-equivelar map on $\mathbb{S}^2$ which is not vertex-transitive. More precisely, we show that a semi-equivelar map on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is the boundary of a Platonic solid, an Archimedean solid, a regular prism, an antiprism or the pseudorhombicuboctahedron. As a consequence, we show that all the semi-equivelar maps on $\mathbb{RP}^2$ are vertex-transitive. Moreover, every semi-equivelar map on $\mathbb{S}^2$ can be geometrized, i.e., every semi-equivelar map on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is isomorphic to a semi-regular tiling of $\mathbb{S}^2$. In the course of the proof of our main result, we present a combinatorial characterization in terms of an inequality of all the types of semi-equivelar maps on $\mathbb{S}^2$. Here, we present self-contained combinatorial proofs of all our results. ",mathematics
"  When a channel model is available, learning how to communicate on fading noisy channels can be formulated as the (unsupervised) training of an autoencoder consisting of the cascade of encoder, channel, and decoder. An important limitation of the approach is that training should be generally carried out from scratch for each new channel. To cope with this problem, prior works considered joint training over multiple channels with the aim of finding a single pair of encoder and decoder that works well on a class of channels. As a result, joint training ideally mimics the operation of non-coherent transmission schemes. In this paper, we propose to obviate the limitations of joint training via meta-learning: Rather than training a common model for all channels, meta-learning finds a common initialization vector that enables fast training on any channel. The approach is validated via numerical results, demonstrating significant training speed-ups, with effective encoders and decoders obtained with as little as one iteration of Stochastic Gradient Descent.

"  We introduce a new hybrid qubit consisting of a Majorana qubit interacting with a transmon longitudinally coupled to a resonator. To do so, we equip the longitudinal transmon qubit with topological quasiparticles, supported by an array of heterostructure nanowires, and derive charge- and phase-based interactions between the Majorana qubit and the resonator and transmon degrees of freedom. Inspecting the charge coupling, we demonstrate that the Majorana self-charging can be eliminated by a judicious choice of charge offset, thereby maintaining the Majorana degeneracy regardless of the quasiparticles spatial arrangement and parity configuration. We perform analytic and numerical calculations to derive the effective qubit-qubit interaction elements and discuss their potential utility for state readout and quantum error correction. Further, we find that select interactions depend strongly on the overall superconducting parity, which may provide a direct mechanism to characterize deleterious quasiparticle poisoning processes.

"  We discuss in a statistical physics framework the idea that ``the whole is less than the parts'', as sometimes advocated by sociologists in view of the intrinsic complexity of humans, and try to reconcile this idea with the statistical physicists wisdom according to which ``the whole is more than the sum of its parts'' due to collective phenomena. We consider a simple mean-field model of interacting agents having an intrinsic complexity modeled by a large number of internal configurations. We show by analytically solving the model that interactions between agents lead, in some parameter range, to a `standardization' of agents in the sense that all agents collapse in the same internal state, thereby drastically suppressing their complexity. Slightly generalizing the model, we find that agents standardization may lead to a global order if appropriate interactions are included. Hence, in this simple model, both agents standardization and collective organization may be viewed as two sides of the same coin. ",physics
"  With the rapid development of various services in wireless communications, spectrum resource has become increasingly valuable. Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling, which was proposed in the 1970s, has been a promising paradigm to improve the spectrum utilization. In this paper, we try to apply FTN into secure communications and propose a secure and high-spectrum-efficiency transmission system based on FTN and deep learning (DL). In the proposed system, the hopping symbol packing ratio with random values makes it difficult for the eavesdropper to obtain the accurate symbol rate and inter-symbol interference (ISI). While the receiver can use the blind estimation to choose the true parameters with the aid of DL. The results show that without the accurate symbol packing ratio, the eavesdropper will suffer from severe performance degradation. As a result, the system can achieve a secure transmission with a higher spectrum efficiency. Also, we propose a simplified symbol packing ratio estimation which has bee employed in our proposed system. Results show that the proposed simplified estimation achieves nearly the same performance as the original structure while its complexity has been greatly reduced.

"  The early detection of tipping points, which describe a rapid departure from a stable state, is an important theoretical and practical challenge. Tipping points are most commonly associated with the disappearance of steady-state or periodic solutions at fold bifurcations. We discuss here multi-frequency tipping (M-tipping), which is tipping due to the disappearance of an attracting torus. M-tipping is a generic phenomenon in systems with at least two intrinsic or external frequencies that can interact and, hence, is relevant to a wide variety of systems of interest. We show that the more complicated sequence of bifurcations involved in M-tipping provides a possible consistent explanation for as yet unexplained behavior observed near tipping in climate models for the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. More generally, this work provides a path towards identifying possible early-warning signs of tipping in multiple-frequency systems. ",mathematics
"  Phase field theory for fracture is developed at large strains with an emphasis on a correct introduction of surface stresses. This is achieved by multiplying the cohesion and gradient energies by the local ratio of the crack surface areas in the deformed and undeformed configurations and with the gradient energy in terms of the gradient of the order parameter in the reference configuration. This results in an expression for the surface stresses which is consistent with the sharp surface approach. Namely, the structural part of the Cauchy surface stress represents an isotropic biaxial tension, with the magnitude of a force per unit length equal to the surface energy. The surface stresses are a result of the geometric nonlinearities, even when strains are infinitesimal. They make multiple contributions to the Ginzburg-Landau equation for damage evolution, both in the deformed and undeformed configurations. Important connections between material parameters are obtained using an analytical solution for two separating surfaces, as well as an analysis of the stress-strain curves for homogeneous tension for different degradation and interpolation functions. A complete system of equations is presented in the undeformed and deformed configurations.

"  Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is a standard computational tool for describing chemical reactivity in systems with many degrees of freedom, including polymers, enzymes, and reacting molecules in complex solvents. However, QM/MM is less suitable for systems with complex MM dynamics due to associated long relaxation times, the high computational cost of QM energy evaluations, and expensive long-range electrostatics. Recently, a systematic coarse-graining of the MM part was proposed to overcome these QM/MM limitations in the form of the quantum mechanics/coarse-grained molecular mechanics (QM/CG-MM) approach. Herein, we recast QM/CG-MM in the density functional theory formalism and, by employing the force-matching variational principle, access the method performance for two model systems: QM CCl4 in the MM CCl4 liquid and the reaction of tert-butyl hypochlorite with the benzyl radical in the MM CCl4 solvent. We find that DFT-QM/CG-MM accurately reproduces DFT-QM/MM radial distribution functions and 3-body correlations between QM and CG-MM subsystems. The free energy profile of the reaction is also described well, with an error < 1-2 kcal/mol. DFT-QM/CG-MM is a general, systematic, and computationally efficient approach to include chemical reactivity in coarse-grained molecular models. ",physics

In this paper, methods, both qualitative and quantitative, for analyzing TCAS from an adversarial perspective are presented. To demonstrate the feasibility of inducing near mid-air collisions between current day TCAS-equipped aircraft, an experimental Phantom Aircraft generator is developed using GNU Radio and an SDR against a realistic threat model.

"  This work concerns the numerical approximation of a multicomponent compressible Euler system for a fluid mixture in multiple space dimensions on unstructured meshes with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM). We first derive an entropy stable (ES) and robust (i.e., that preserves the positivity of the partial densities and internal energy) three-point finite volume scheme using relaxation-based approximate Riemann solvers from Bouchut [Nonlinear stability of finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws and well-balanced schemes for sources, Birkhauser] and Coquel and Perthame [SINUM, 35, 1998]. Then, we consider the DGSEM based on collocation of quadrature and interpolation points which relies on the framework introduced by Fisher and Carpenter [JCP, 252, 2013] and Gassner [SISC, 35, 2013]. We replace the physical fluxes in the integrals over discretization elements by entropy conservative numerical fluxes [Tadmor, MCOM, 49, 1987], while ES numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. We thus derive a two-point numerical flux satisfying the Tadmor's entropy conservation condition and use the numerical flux from the three-point scheme as ES flux. Time discretization is performed with a strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme. We then derive conditions on the numerical parameters to guaranty a semi-discrete entropy inequality as well as positivity of the cell average of the partial densities and internal energy of the fully discrete DGSEM at any approximation order. The later results allow to use existing limiters in order to restore positivity of nodal values within elements. The scheme also resolves exactly stationary material interfaces. Numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions on flows with discontinuous solutions support the conclusions of our analysis and highlight stability, robustness and high resolution of the scheme.

"  We study the minimum time to implement an arbitrary two-qubit gate in two heteronuclear spins systems. We give a systematic characterization of two-qubit gates based on the invariants of local equivalence. The quantum gates are classified into four classes, and for each class the analytical formula of the minimum time to implement the quantum gates is explicitly presented. For given quantum gates, by calculating the corresponding invariants one easily obtains the classes to which the quantum gates belong. In particular, we analyze the effect of global phases on the minimum time to implement the gate. Our results present complete solutions to the optimal time problem in implementing an arbitrary two-qubit gate in two heteronuclear spins systems. Detailed examples are given to typical two-qubit gates with or without global phases. ",quantum physics
"  Early detection of diabetic retinopathy prevents visual loss and blindness of a human eye. Based on the types of feature extraction method used, DR detection method can be broadly classified as Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based and traditional feature extraction (machine learning) based. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing feature extraction methods based on Deep CNN and conventional feature extraction for DR detection. In addition to that, this paper focuses on the severity scale measurement of the DR detection and to the best of our knowledge this is the first survey paper which covers severity grading scale. It is also necessary to mention that this is the first study which reviews the proposed Deep CNN based method in the state of the art for DR detection methods. This study discovers that recently proposed deep learning based DR detection methods provides higher accuracy than existing traditional feature extraction methods in the literature and also useful in large scale datasets. However, deep learning based methods require GPU implementation to get the desirable output. The one of the other major finding of this paper is that there are no obvious standard severity scale detection criteria to measure the grading. Some used binary class while many other used multi stage class. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  We observe the actions of a $K$ sub-sample of $N$ individuals up to time $t$ for some large $K<N$. We model the relationships of individuals by i.i.d. Bernoulli($p$)-random variables, where $p\in (0,1]$ is an unknown parameter. The rate of action of each individual depends on some unknown parameter $\mu> 0$ and on the sum of some function $\phi$ of the ages of the actions of the individuals which influence him. The function $\phi$ is unknown but we assume it rapidly decays. The aim of this paper is to estimate the parameter $p$ asymptotically as $N\to \infty$, $K\to \infty$, and $t\to \infty$. Let $m_t$ be the average number of actions per individual up to time $t$. In the subcritical case, where $m_t$ increases linearly, we build an estimator of $p$ with the rate of convergence $\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}+\frac{N}{m_t\sqrt{K}}+\frac{N}{K\sqrt{m_t}}$. In the supercritical case, where $m_{t}$ increases exponentially fast, we build an estimator of $p$ with the rate of convergence $\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}+\frac{N}{m_{t}\sqrt{K}}$. ",mathematics

"  In analogy to the development of fluorescent proteins, innovative tools for screening optoacoustic cell labels could lead to tailored protein labels for OA, imparting novel ways to visualize biological structure and function. Optoacoustic imaging emerges towards a highly promising modality for life sciences and medical practise with advantageous capabilities such as great accessible depth, and 3D studying of living tissue. The development of novel labels with molecular specificity could significantly enhance the optoacoustic contrast, specificity, and sensitivity and allow optoacoustic to interrogate tissues not amenable to the fluorescence method. We report on an optoacoustic flow cytometer (OAFC) prototype, developed for screening optoacoustic reporter genes. The cytometer concurrently records light scattering for referencing purposes. Since recording light scattering is completely independent from OA, we believe it to be a more reliable referencing method than e.g. fluorescence or ultrasound-backscatter. Precise characterization of our OAFC prototype showcases its ability to optoacoustically characterize objects in-flow that are in the size range of single cells. We apply the OAFC to distinguish individual E. coli cells based on optoacoustic properties of their expressed chromoproteins read in-flow using microfluidic arrangements and achieved precisions over 90%. We discuss how the light scattering referenced OAFC method offers a critical step towards routine measurement of optoacoustic properties of single-cells and could pave the way for identifying genetically encoded optoacoustic reporters, by transferring working concepts of the fluorescence field.

"  We use Gaia DR2 systemic proper motions of 45 satellite galaxies to constrain the mass of the Milky Way using the scale free mass estimator of Watkins et al. (2010). We first determine the anisotropy parameter $\beta$, and the tracer satellites' radial density index $\gamma$ to be $\beta$=$-0.67^{+0.45}_{-0.62}$ and $\gamma=2.11\pm0.23$. When we exclude possible former satellites of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the anisotropy changes to $\beta$=$-0.21^{+0.37}_{-0.51}$. We find that the index of the Milky Way's gravitational potential $\alpha$, which is dependent on the mass itself, is the parameter with the largest impact on the mass determination. Via comparison with cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, we carried out a detailed analysis of the estimation of the observational uncertainties and their impact on the mass estimator. We found that the mass estimator is biased when applied naively to the satellites of simulated Milky Way halos. Correcting for this bias, we obtain for our Galaxy a mass of $0.58^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ within 64 kpc, as computed from the inner half of our observational sample, and $1.43^{+0.35}_{-0.32}\times10^{12}$M$_\odot$ within 273 kpc, from the full sample; this latter value extrapolates to a virial mass of $M_\mathrm{vir\,\Delta=97}$=$1.51^{+0.45}_{-0.40} \times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ corresponding to a virial radius of R$_\mathrm{vir}$=$308\pm29$ kpc. This value of the Milky Way mass lies in-between other mass estimates reported in the literature, from various different methods. ",astrophysics
"  Experiments on light dragging in a moving medium laid the cornerstones of modern physics more than a century ago, and they still are in the focus of current research. When linearly polarized light is transmitted through a rotating dielectric, the polarization plane is slightly rotated -- a phenomenon first studied by Fermi in 1923. For typical non-resonant dielectric materials, the measured polarization drag angle does not surpass several microradians. Here we show that this effect may be dramatically enhanced if the light is sent to a gas of fast unidirectionally spinning molecular superrotors. Several femtosecond-laser labs have already succeeded in optically creating such a medium. We show that the specific rotation power of the superrotor medium exceeds the values previously observed in mechanically rotated bulk optical specimens by many orders of magnitude. This nonreciprocal opto-mechanical phenomenon may open new avenues for ultra-fast control of the polarization state of light. ",physics

Contrary to the popular belief that achieving a stable synchronized state is tied chiefly to system inertia, our results instead highlight the critical role of generator damping in achieving this pivotal state. Additionally, we report the feasibility of operating interconnected electric grids with a 100% power contribution from renewable generation technologies with assured system synchronization.

"  Automatic differentiation is a tool for numerically calculating derivatives of a given function up to machine precision. This tool is useful for quantum chemistry methods, which require the calculation of gradients either for the minimization of the energy with respect to wave function parameters or for the calculation of molecular responses to external perturbations. Herein, we apply automatic differentiation to the coupled cluster with doubles method, in which the wave function parameters are obtained by minimizing the energy Lagrangian. The benefit of this approach is that the l amplitudes can be obtained without implementation of the usual L-equations, thereby reducing the coding effort by approximately a factor of two. We also show that the excitation energies at the coupled cluster level can be ontained with only a few lines of the code using automatic differentiation. We further apply automatic differentiation to the multicomponent coupled cluster with doubles method, which treats more than one type of particle, such as electrons and protons, quantum mechanically. This approach will be especially useful for prototyping, debugging, and testing multicomponent quantum chemistry methods because reference and benchmark data are limited in this emerging field.

"  In this paper, two large-scale fading path loss models are presented based on indoor and outdoor channel measurements at 73 GHz. The line-of-sight millimeter-wave propagation measurement campaigns were uniquely conducted within the indoor and outdoor environments at an airport setting, i.e., the Boise Airport. The channel measurements were made with directional transmit and receive antennas with a 24 dBi gain at different receive antenna heights. From the measured data, we obtained the parameters of two path loss models, i.e., the close-in reference distance model (CIM) and the floating-intercept model (FIM). Results show that the path loss exponents estimated from the CIM are very close to that of the free-space path loss model, while the FIM provides a better fit to the measurement data.

"  Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to fundamentally transform society but faces multiple challenges in doing so. In particular, state-of-the-art neuromorphic devices used to implement AI typically lack processes like neuromodulation and neural oscillations that are critical for enabling many advanced cognitive abilities shown by the brain. Here, we utilize smart materials, that adapt their structure and properties in response to external stimuli, to emulate the modulatory behaviour of neurons called neuromodulation. Leveraging these materials, we have designed and simulated the dynamics of a self-adaptive artificial neuron, which comprises five magnetic skyrmions hosted in a bilayer of thulium iron garnet (TmIG) and platinum (Pt). Micromagnetic simulations show that both the amplitudes and frequencies of neuronal dynamics can be modified by reconfiguring the skyrmion lattice, thereby actualizing neuromodulation. Further, we demonstrate that this neuron achieves a significant advancement over state-of-the-art by realizing the advanced cognitive abilities of context-awareness, cross-frequency coupling as well as information fusion, while utilizing ultra-low power and being ultra-compact. Building advanced cognition into AI can fundamentally transform a wide array of fields including personalized medicine, neuro-prosthesis, human-machine interaction and help realize the next-generation of context-aware AI.

Here we perform the first comprehensive study of variants of NN-based learning and inference for astronomical time-series, aiming to provide the community with an overview on relative performance and, hopefully, a set of best-in-class choices for practical implementations. In both supervised and self-supervised contexts, we study the effects of different time-series-compatible layer choices, namely the dilated temporal convolutional neural network (dTCNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) NNs, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and temporal convolutional NNs (tCNNs). We also study the efficacy and performance of encoder-decoder (i.e., autoencoder) networks compared to direct classification networks, different pathways to include auxiliary (non-time-series) metadata, and different approaches to incorporate multi-passband data (i.e., multiple time-series per source). Performance---applied to a sample of 17,604 variable stars from the MACHO survey across 10 imbalanced classes---is measured in training convergence time, classification accuracy, reconstruction error, and generated latent variables. We find that networks with Recurrent NN (RNNs) generally outperform dTCNs and, in many scenarios, yield to similar accuracy as tCNNs. In learning time and memory requirements, convolution-based layers are more performant. We conclude by discussing the advantages and limitations of deep architectures for variable star classification, with a particular eye towards next-generation surveys such as LSST, WFIRST and ZTF2.

While the main accomplishments of this paper concern the geometry of Shimura varieties and consequences for differential operators, we conclude with applications to Galois representations. Our approach involves a careful analysis of the behavior of Shimura varieties and enables us to obtain significantly more general results than allowed by prior techniques, including for arbitrary signature, vector weights, and unramified primes in CM fields of arbitrary degree.

"  Chatter detection from sensor signals has been an active field of research. While some success has been reported using several featurization tools and machine learning algorithms, existing methods have several drawbacks such as manual preprocessing and requiring a large data set. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for chatter detection based on K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm for classification and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as a time series similarity measure. The used time series are the acceleration signals acquired from the tool holder in a series of turning experiments. Our results, show that this approach achieves detection accuracies that in most cases outperform existing methods. We compare our results to the traditional methods based on Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) and the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD), as well as to the more recent Topological Data Analysis (TDA) based approach. We show that in three out of four cutting configurations our DTW-based approach attains the highest average classification rate reaching in one case as high as 99% accuracy. Our approach does not require feature extraction, is capable of reusing a classifier across different cutting configurations, and it uses reasonably sized training sets. Although the resulting high accuracy in our approach is associated with high computational cost, this is specific to the DTW implementation that we used. Specifically, we highlight available, very fast DTW implementations that can even be implemented on small consumer electronics. Therefore, further code optimization and the significantly reduced computational effort during the implementation phase make our approach a viable option for in-process chatter detection.

"  At millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, the higher cost and power consumption of hardware components in multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems do not allow beamforming entirely at the baseband with a separate radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna. In such scenarios, to enable spatial multiplexing, hybrid beamforming, which uses phase shifters to connect a fewer number of RF chains to a large number of antennas is a cost effective and energy-saving alternative. This paper describes our research on fully adaptive transceivers that adapt their behaviour on a frame-by-frame basis, so that a mmWave hybrid MIMO system always operates in the most energy efficient manner. Exhaustive search based brute force approach is computationally intensive, so we study fractional programming as a low-cost alternative to solve the problem which maximizes energy efficiency. The performance results indicate that the resulting mmWave hybrid MIMO transceiver achieves significantly improved energy efficiency results compared to the baseline cases involving analogue-only or digital-only signal processing solutions, and shows performance trade-offs with the brute force approach.

Pseudo-accordiohedra parametrize a family of projective forms on the abstract kinematic space defined by AHST and restriction of these forms to the type-D associahedra can be associated to one-loop integrands for quartic interactions.

"  A surface moving mesh method is presented for general surfaces with or without explicit parameterization. The method can be viewed as a nontrivial extension of the moving mesh partial differential equation method that has been developed for bulk meshes and demonstrated to work well for various applications. The main challenges in the development of surface mesh movement come from the fact that the Jacobian matrix of the affine mapping between the reference element and any simplicial surface element is not square. The development starts with revealing the relation between the area of a surface element in the Euclidean or Riemannian metric and the Jacobian matrix of the corresponding affine mapping, formulating the equidistribution and alignment conditions for surface meshes, and establishing a meshing energy function based on the conditions. The moving mesh equation is then defined as the gradient system of the energy function, with the nodal mesh velocities being projected onto the underlying surface. The analytical expression for the mesh velocities is obtained in a compact, matrix form, which makes the implementation of the new method on a computer relatively easy and robust. Moreover, it is analytically shown that any mesh trajectory generated by the method remains nonsingular if it is so initially. It is emphasized that the method is developed directly on surface meshes, making no use of any information on surface parameterization. It utilizes surface normal vectors to ensure that the mesh vertices remain on the surface while moving, and also assumes that the initial surface mesh is given. The new method can apply to general surfaces with or without explicit parameterization since the surface normal vectors can be computed even when the surface only has a numerical representation. A selection of two- and three-dimensional examples are presented. ",mathematics

We clarify classical vacua of the theory and derive fractional instanton solutions connecting these vacua. The resulting phase structure based on DIGA exhibits the quantum phase transitions and triple degeneracy at special points in the $(\theta_1,\theta_2)$-plane, which is consistent with the phase diagram obtained from the anomaly matching and global inconsistency conditions. This result indicates the adiabatic continuity between the flag sigma models on ${\mathbb R}^{2}$ and ${\mathbb R}\times S^{1}$ with small compactification radius.

"  The small-scale turbulent dynamo is an important process contributing to the cosmic magnetization. In partially ionized astrophysical plasmas, the dynamo growth of magnetic energy strongly depends on the coupling state between ions and neutrals and the ion-neutral collisional damping effect. A new damping stage of turbulent dynamo in a weakly ionized medium was theoretically predicted by Xu \& Lazarian (2016). By carrying out a 3D two-fluid dynamo simulation, here we for the first time numerically confirmed the physical conditions and the linear-in-time growth of magnetic field strength of the damping stage of dynamo. The dynamo-amplified magnetic field has a characteristic length as the damping scale, which increases with time and can reach the injection scale of turbulence after around eight largest eddy-turnover times given sufficiently low ionization fraction and weak initial magnetic field. Due to the weak coupling between ions and neutrals, most turbulent energy carried by neutrals cannot be converted to the magnetic energy, resulting in a relatively weak magnetic field at the end of dynamo. This result has important implications for the growth of magnetic fields in the partially ionized interstellar medium and shock acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. ",astrophysics

Around the $K$-point, the dispersion relation represents an ideal system to study intricately coupled intraband motion and interband (Landau-Zener) transitions driven by the optical field of phase-controlled few-cycle laser pulses.

Here we report the results of one of the largest municipal lighting dimming experiments to date, involving $\sim$20,000 roadway luminaires owned and operated by the City of Tucson, Arizona, U.S. We analyzed both single-channel and spatially resolved ground-based measurements of broadband night sky radiance obtained during the tests, determining that the zenith sky brightness during the tests decreased by ($-5.4\pm0.9$)% near the city center and ($-3.6\pm0.9$)% at an adjacent suburban location on nights when the output of the street lighting system was dimmed from 90% of its full power draw to 30% after local midnight. Modeling these changes with a radiative transfer code yields results suggesting that street lights account for about ($14\pm1$)% of light emissions resulting in skyglow seen over the city. A separate derivation from first principles implies that street lighting contributes only 2-3% of light seen at the zenith over Tucson. We discuss this inconsistency and suggest routes for future work. ",astrophysics
"  Previous studies have shown the filamentary structures in the cosmic web influence the alignments of nearby galaxies. We study this effect in the LOWZ sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using the ""Cosmic Web Reconstruction"" filament catalogue. We find that LOWZ galaxies exhibit a small but statistically significant alignment in the direction parallel to the orientation of nearby filaments. This effect is detectable even in the absence of nearby galaxy clusters, which suggests it is an effect from the matter distribution in the filament. A nonparametric regression model suggests that the alignment effect with filaments extends over separations of 30-40 Mpc. We find that galaxies that are bright and early-forming align more strongly with the directions of nearby filaments than those that are faint and late-forming; however, trends with stellar mass are less statistically significant, within the narrow range of stellar mass of this sample.

"  Eclipsing binaries (EBs) are unique targets for measuring precise stellar properties and constrain stellar evolution models. In particular, it is possible to measure at the percent level masses and radii of both components of a double-lined spectroscopic EB. Since the advent of high-precision photometric space missions (MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, BRITE, TESS), the use of stellar pulsation properties to infer stellar interiors and dynamics constitutes a revolution for low-mass star studies. The Kepler mission has led to the discovery of thousands of classical pulsators such as $\delta$ Scuti and solar-like oscillators (main sequence and evolved), but also almost 3000 EBs with orbital periods shorter than 1100 days. We report the first systematic search for stellar pulsators in the entire Kepler eclipsing binary catalog. The focus is mainly aimed at discovering $\delta$ Scuti, $\gamma$ Doradus, red giant, and tidally excited pulsators. We developed a data inspection tool (DIT) that automatically produces a series of plots from the Kepler light-curves that allows us to visually identify whether stellar oscillations are present in a given time series. We applied the DIT to the whole Kepler eclipsing binary database and identified 303 systems whose light curves display oscillations, including 163 new discoveries. A total of 149 stars are flagged as $\delta$ Scuti (100 from this paper), 115 stars as $\gamma$ Doradus (69 new), 85 stars as red giants (27 new), 59 as tidally excited oscillators (29 new). There is some overlap among these groups, as some display several types of oscillations. Despite many of these systems are likely to be false positives, i. e., when an EB light curve is blended with a pulsator, this catalog gathers a vast sample of systems that are valuable for a better understanding of stellar evolution.

"  We consider Cauchy problem of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with initial data $u_0\in L^1(\mathbb{R}^3)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. There exist a maximum time interval $[0,T_{max})$ and a unique solution $u\in C\big([0,T_{max}); L^2(\mathbb{R}^3) \cap L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)\big)$ ($\forall p>3$). We find one of function class $S_{regular}$ defined by scaling invariant norm pair such that $T_{max}=\infty$ provided $u_0\in S_{regular}$. Especially, $\|u_0\|_{L^p}$ is arbitrarily large for any $u_0\in S_{regular}$ and $p>3$. On the other hand, the alternative theorem is proved. It is that either $T_{max}= \infty$ or $T_{max}\in(T_l,T_r]$. Especially, $T_r<T_{max}<\infty$ is disappearing. Here the explicit expressions of $T_l$ and $T_r$ are given. This alternative theorem is one kind of regular criterion which can be verified by computer. If $T_{max}=\infty$, the solution $u$ is regular for any $(t,x)\in(0,\infty) \times \mathbb{R}^3$. As $t\rightarrow\infty$, the solution is decay. On the other hand, lower bound of blow up rate of $u$ is obtained again provided $T_{max}\in (T_l,T_r]$. ",mathematics
"  We study the spatially resolved (sub-kpc) gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma$)--star formation rate (SFR) relation in the FIRE-2 (Feedback in Realistic Environments) cosmological simulations. We specifically focus on Milky Way mass disk galaxies at late times. In agreement with observations, we find a relatively flat relationship, with $\sigma \approx 15-30$ km/s in neutral gas across 3 dex in SFRs. We show that higher dense gas fractions (ratios of dense gas to neutral gas) and SFRs are correlated at constant $\sigma$. Similarly, lower gas fractions (ratios of gas to stellar mass) are correlated with higher $\sigma$ at constant SFR. The limits of the $\sigma$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation correspond to the onset of strong outflows. We see evidence of ""on-off"" cycles of star formation in the simulations, corresponding to feedback injection timescales of 10-100 Myr, where SFRs oscillate about equilibrium SFR predictions. Finally, SFRs and velocity dispersions in the simulations agree well with feedback-regulated and marginally stable gas disk (Toomre's $Q =1$) model predictions, and the data effectively rule out models assuming that gas turns into stars at (low) constant efficiency (i.e., ${\rm 1\%}$ per free-fall time). And although the simulation data do not entirely exclude gas accretion/gravitationally powered turbulence as a driver of $\sigma$, it appears to be strongly subdominant to stellar feedback in the simulated galaxy disks.

"  In a multipartite scenario quantum entanglement manifests its most dramatic form when the state is genuinely entangled. Such a state is more beneficial for information theoretic applications if it contains distillable entanglement in every bipartition. It is, therefore, of significant operational interest to identify subspaces of multipartite quantum systems that contain such properties apriori. In this letter, we introduce the notion of unextendible biseparable bases (UBB) that provides an adequate method to construct genuinely entangled subspaces (GES). We provide an explicit construction of two types of UBBs -- party symmetric and party asymmetric -- for every $3$-{\it qudit} quantum system, with local dimension d\ge 3. Further, we show that the GES resulting from the symmetric construction is indeed a {\it bidistillable} subspace, i.e., all the states supported on it contain distillable entanglement across every bipartition.

"  The work discusses the diffusional growth in particulate systems such as atmospheric clouds. It focuses on the Eulerian modeling approach in which the evolution of the probability density function describing the particle size spectrum is carried out using a fixed-bin discretization. The numerical diffusion problem inherent to the employment of the fixed-bin discretization is scrutinized. The work focuses on the applications of MPDATA family of numerical schemes. Several MPDATA variants are explored including: infinite-gauge, non-oscillatory, third-order-terms and recursive antidiffusive correction (double pass donor cell, DPDC) options. Methodology for handling coordinate transformations associated with both particle size distribution variable choice and numerical grid layout are expounded. The study uses PyMPDATA - a new open-source Python implementation of MPDATA. Analysis of the performance of the scheme for different discretization parameters and different settings of the algorithm is performed using an analytically solvable test case pertinent to condensational growth of cloud droplets. The analysis covers spatial and temporal convergence, computational cost, conservativeness and quantification of the numerical broadening of the particle size spectrum. Presented results demonstrate that, for the problem considered, even a tenfold decrease of the spurious numerical spectral broadening can be obtained by a proper choice of the MPDATA variant (maintaining the same spatial and temporal resolution).

"  Software-Defined Metamaterials (SDMs) show a strong potential for advancing the engineered control of electromagnetic waves. As such, they are envisioned to enable a variety of exciting applications, among others in the domains of smart textiles, high-resolution structural monitoring, and sensing in challenging environments. Many of the applications envisage deformations of the SDM structure, such as its bending, stretching or rolling, which implies that the locations of metamaterial elements will be changing relative to one another. In this paper, we argue that if the metamaterial elements would be accurately localizable, this location information could potentially be utilized for enabling novel SDM applications, as well as for optimizing the control of the elements themselves. To enable their localization, we assume that these elements are controlled wirelessly through a Terahertz (THz)-operating nanonetwork. We consider the elements to be energy-constrained, with their sole powering option being to harvest environmental energy. By means of simulation, we demonstrate sub-millimeter accuracy of the two-way Time of Flight (ToF)-based localization, as well as high availability of the service (i.e., consistently more than 80% of the time), which is a result of the low energy consumed during localization. Finally, we qualitatively characterize the latency of the proposed localization service, as well as outline several challenges and future research directions.

"  In this work we make use of the Ricci flow equations to show that, by starting from a general ansatz for the metric, we can construct two kinds of Lifshitz spaces in which: (a) the critical exponent coincides with the spatial dimension of the spacetime and therefore adopts discrete values, and (b) the critical exponent is continuous and arbitrary. These results show that Lifshitz spaces are exact solutions to the Ricci flow equations. Moreover, we found that the Ricci flow evolves towards a single fixed point for both cases which coincides with the flat spacetime. ",high energy physics theory

As a separate element of the fine structure, a continuous network of dark intergranular gaps is considered. The results of image processing of micropores and faculaes knots obtained using modern adaptive telescopes are presented. For intergranular gaps and micropores, a stationary regime of magnetic diffusion is determined, in which horizontal-vertical plasma flows converging to the gap (and micropores) compensate for the dissipative spreading of the magnetic flux on a given scale. A theoretical assessment of the characteristic scales of these structures in the photosphere is obtained: 20-30 km for the thickness of dark intergranular spaces and 200-400 km for the diameter of micropores.

"  The luminescence properties of the $\mathrm{[UO_2Cl_4]^{2-}}$ complex in an organic phase, especially the influence of large organic counter cations, have been studied by time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) and ab initio modeling. The experimental spectrum was assigned by vibronic Franck-Condon calculations on quantum chemical models based on relativistic density functional approaches. The shape of the luminescence spectrum of the uranyl tetrachloride complex is determined by symmetrical vibrations and geometrical change upon emission. The possible change of the luminescence properties depending on the first and second uranyl coordination sphere was predicted theoretically for $\mathrm{[UO_2Br_4]^{2-}}$ and $\mathrm{[R_4N]_2[UO_2Cl_4]}$ ($\mathrm{R_4N}$ = $\mathrm{[Bu_4N]}$, $\mathrm{[{A336}]}$) systems. The computations reveal that for U(VI), the second coordination sphere has little influence on the spectrum shape, making speciation of uranyl complexes with identical first coordination-sphere ligands tedious to discriminate. The computed structural changes agreed well with experimental trends; theoretical spectra and peaks attribution are in a good accordance with TRLFS and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) data respectively.

"  We report on our calculations of differential hyperfine anomalies in the nuclear single-particle model for a number of atoms and ions of interest for studies of fundamental symmetries violations. Comparison with available experimental data allows one to discriminate between different nuclear magnetization models, and this data supports the use of the nuclear single-particle model over the commonly-used uniform ball model. Accurate modelling of the nuclear magnetization distribution is important for testing atomic theory through hyperfine comparisons. The magnetization distribution must be adequately understood and modelled, with uncertainties well under the atomic theory uncertainty, for hyperfine comparisons to be meaningful. This has not been the case for a number of atoms of particular interest for precision studies, including Cs. Our work demonstrates the validity of the nuclear single-particle model for Cs, and this has implications for the theory analysis of atomic parity violation in this atom. ",physics
"  For the high-luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), at the expected position of the innermost pixel detector layer of the CMS and ATLAS experiments, the estimated equivalent neutron fluence after 3000 fb$^{-1}$ is 2$\cdot$10$^{16}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$, and the IEL (Ionizing Energy Loss) dose in the SiO$_2$ 12 MGy. The optimisation of the pixel sensors and the understanding of their performance as a function of fluence and dose makes a radiation damage model for TCAD simulations, which describes the available experimental data, highly desirable. The currently available bulk-damage models are not able to describe simultaneously the measurements of dark current (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V) and charge collection efficiency (CCE) of pad diodes for fluences $\ge 1\cdot 10^{15}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$. Therefore, for the development and validation of a new accurate bulk damage model we use I-V, C-V and CCE measurements on pad diodes available within the CMS-HPK campaign and data from samples irradiated recently with 24 GeV/c protons. For the determination of the radiation-induced damage parameters we utilise the ""optimiser"" of Synopsys TCAD, which allows the minimisation of the difference between the measured and simulated I-V, C-V and CCE. The outcome of this optimisation, the Hamburg Penta Trap Model (HPTM), provides a consistent and accurate description of the measurements of diodes irradiated with protons in the fluence range from 3$\cdot$10$^{14}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$ to 1.3$\cdot$10$^{16}$ n$_{eq}$/cm$^2$.

"  Efficient implementation of quantum algorithms requires single- or multi-qubit gates with high fidelity. In this report, we report that the fidelity of single-qubit gate operations on open quantum systems has a maximum value corresponding to an optimum value of the drive-amplitude in the presence of drive-induced decoherence. To show this, we use a previously reported fluctuation-regulated quantum master equation [Phys. Rev. A 97, 063837 (2018)]. The fidelity is found to be a function of the drive-induced dissipative terms as well as the relaxation terms arising from the qubit-environment coupling; as a result, it behaves non-monotonically with the drive-amplitude. The existence of an optimum drive-amplitude implies that the single-qubit operations on open quantum systems would have an optimal clock speed. ",quantum physics
"  The 3d spin-3 gravity theory is holographically dual to a 2d ${\cal W}_3$-extended CFT. In a large-c limit the symmetry algebra of the CFT reduces to $SU(1,2) \times SU(1,2)$. On the ground of symmetry the dual bulk space-time will be given by an 8d group manifold $SU(1,2)$. Hence we need to introduce five extra coordinates in addition to three ordinary ones. The 3d space-time is a 3d hyper-surface $\Sigma$ embedded at constant values of the extra variables. Operators in the CFT at the boundary of $\Sigma$ are expressed in terms of ${\cal W}$ descendants of the operators at the boundary of $\Sigma_0$, where the extra variables vanish. In this paper it is shown that AdS/CFT correspondence for a scalar field coupled to 3d spin-3 gravity is realized in this auxiliary 8d space. A bulk-to-boundary propagator of a scalar field is found and a generating functional of boundary two-point functions of scalar ${\cal W}$-descendant operators is obtained by using the classical action for the scalar field. Classically, the scalar field must satisfy both Klein-Gordon equation and a third-order differential equation, which are related to the quadratic and cubic Casimir operators of $su(1,2)$. It is found that the coefficient function of the derivatives of the scalar field in the latter equation is the spin-3 gauge field, when restricted to the hypersurface. An action integral in the 8d auxiliary space for the 3d spin-3 gravity coupled to a scalar field is presented. An 8d local frame is introduced and the equations of motion for the 8d connections $A_{\mu}$, $\overline{A}_{\mu}$ are solved. By restricting those solutions onto $\Sigma$, flat connections in 3d $SL(3,\mathbb{R}) \times SL(3,\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory are obtained and new 3d black hole solutions with and without spin-3 charge are found by this method.

"  The software defined air-ground integrated vehicular (SD-AGV) networks have emerged as a promising paradigm, which realize the flexible on-ground resource sharing to support innovative applications for UAVs with heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we investigate a vehicular cloud-assisted graph job allocation problem in SD-AGV networks, where the computation-intensive jobs carried by UAVs, and the vehicular cloud are modeled as graphs. To map each component of the graph jobs to a feasible vehicle, while achieving the trade-off among minimizing UAVs' job completion time, energy consumption, and the data exchange cost among vehicles, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, which is Np-hard. Moreover, the constraint associated with preserving job structures poses addressing the subgraph isomorphism problem, that further complicates the algorithm design. Motivated by which, we propose an efficient decoupled approach by separating the template (feasible mappings between components and vehicles) searching from the transmission power allocation. For the former, we present an efficient algorithm of searching for all the subgraph isomorphisms with low computation complexity. For the latter, we introduce a power allocation algorithm by applying convex optimization techniques.

"  Light field image quality assessment (LFI-QA) is a significant and challenging research problem. It helps to better guide light field acquisition, processing and applications. However, only a few objective models have been proposed and none of them completely consider intrinsic factors affecting the LFI quality. In this paper, we propose a No-Reference Light Field image Quality Assessment (NR-LFQA) scheme, where the main idea is to quantify the LFI quality degradation through evaluating the spatial quality and angular consistency. We first measure the spatial quality deterioration by capturing the naturalness distribution of the light field cyclopean image array, which is formed when human observes the LFI. Then, as a transformed representation of LFI, the Epipolar Plane Image (EPI) contains the slopes of lines and involves the angular information. Therefore, EPI is utilized to extract the global and local features from LFI to measure angular consistency degradation. Specifically, the distribution of gradient direction map of EPI is proposed to measure the global angular consistency distortion in the LFI. We further propose the weighted local binary pattern to capture the characteristics of local angular consistency degradation. Extensive experimental results on four publicly available LFI quality datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2D, 3D, multi-view, and LFI quality assessment algorithms.

The second goal is to exploit this analysis tool in order to study a new class of materials capable of violating mirror symmetry in momentum space, therefore breaking reciprocity principle along different wave propagation directions. This is obtained by considering the plate elastic properties to be discretely modulated in space and continuously in time.

"  As Moore's law reaches its limits, quantum computers are emerging with the promise of dramatically outperforming classical computers. We have witnessed the advent of quantum processors with over $50$ quantum bits (qubits), which are expected to be beyond the reach of classical simulation. Quantum supremacy is the event at which the old Extended Church-Turing Thesis is overturned: A quantum computer performs a task that is practically impossible for any classical (super)computer. The demonstration requires both a solid theoretical guarantee and an experimental realization. The lead candidate is Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), which is the task of sampling from the output distribution of random quantum circuits. Google recently announced a $53-$qubit experimental demonstration of RCS. Soon after, classical algorithms appeared that challenge the supremacy of random circuits by estimating their outputs. How hard is it to classically simulate the output of random quantum circuits?   We prove that estimating the output probabilities of random quantum circuits is formidably hard ($\#P$-Hard) for any classical computer. This makes RCS the strongest candidate for demonstrating quantum supremacy relative to all other proposals. The robustness to the estimation error that we prove may serve as a new hardness criterion for the performance of classical algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce the Cayley path interpolation between any two gates of a quantum computation and convolve recent advances in quantum complexity and information with probability and random matrices. Furthermore, we apply algebraic geometry to generalize the well-known Berlekamp-Welch algorithm that is widely used in coding theory and cryptography. Our results imply that there is an exponential hardness barrier for the classical simulation of most quantum circuits. ",quantum physics

"  Tensor models generalize the matrix-model approach to 2-dimensional quantum gravity to higher dimensions. Some models allowing a $1/N$ expansion have been explored, most of them generating branched-polymer geometries. Recently, enhancements yielding an additional 2d quantum-gravity (planar) phase and an intermediate regime of proliferating baby-universes have been found. It remains an open issue to find models escaping these lower dimensionality universality classes.   Here we analyse the dominant regime and critical behaviour of a range of new models which are candidates for such effective geometries, in particular interactions based on the utility graph $K_{3,3}$. We find that, upon proper enhancement, the two-phase structure of a branched-polymer and a 2d gravity regime is the common case in $U(N)$-invariant rank $D=4$ tensor models of small orders. Not only the well known so-called necklace interactions but also $K_{3,3}$-type interactions turn out as the source for the planar regime. We give a systematic account of the enhancement scaling, the counting of leading-order diagrams and the multi-critical behaviour of a wide range of interactions, in particular for all order-6 interactions of rank 3 and 4. These findings support the claim of universality of such mixtures of branched-polymer and planar diagrams at criticality. In particular, this hints at the necessity to consider new ingredients, or interactions of higher order and rank, in order to obtain higher dimensional continuum geometry from tensor models.

Moreover, these strong emission-line systems span an extremely wide range of stellar mass ($\sim 3$ dex), star-formation rate ($\sim 2$ dex), and [O III] luminosity ($\sim 2$ dex). Comparing the distributions of these properties to those of continuum selected galaxies, we find that emission-line galaxies have systematically lower stellar masses and lower optical/UV dust attenuations. These measurements lay the groundwork for an extensive comparison between these rest-frame optical emission-line galaxies and Ly$\alpha$ emitters identified in the HETDEX survey. ",astrophysics

"  Scientists and engineers often create accurate, trustworthy, computational simulation schemes - but all too often these are too computationally expensive to execute over the time or spatial domain of interest. The equation-free approach is to marry such trusted simulations to a framework for numerical macroscale reduction - the patch dynamics scheme. This article extends the patch scheme to scenarios in which the trusted simulation resolves abrupt state changes on the microscale that appear as shocks on the macroscale. Accurate simulation for problems in these scenarios requires extending the patch scheme by capturing the shock within a novel patch, and also modifying the patch coupling rules in the vicinity in order to maintain accuracy. With these two extensions to the patch scheme, straightforward arguments derive consistency conditions that match the usual order of accuracy for patch schemes. The new scheme is successfully tested on four archetypal problems. This technique will empower scientists and engineers to accurately and efficiently simulate, over large spatial domains, multiscale multiphysics systems that have rapid transition layers on the microscale.

"  Using both computational and experimental methods, the capacity of four different surfactant molecules to inhibit the agglomeration of sII hydrate particles was assessed. The computational simulations were carried out using both steered and non-steered Molecular Dynamics (MD), simulating the coalescence process of a hydrate slab and a water droplet, both covered with surfactant molecules. The experimental work was based on rocking cell measurements, determining the minimum effective dose necessary to inhibit agglomeration. Overall, good agreement was obtained between the performance predicted by the simulations and the experimental measurements. Moreover, the simulations allowed to gain additional insights that are not directly accessible via experiments, such as an analysis of the mass density profiles, the diffusion coefficients, or the orientations of the long tails.

This celestial amplitude is expanded in a basis of 2D conformal partial waves on the unitary principal series, and then rewritten as a sum over 2D conformal blocks via contour deformation.

"  Supersonically induced gas objects (SIGOs) with little to no dark matter component are predicted to exist in patches of the Universe with non-negligible relative velocity between baryons and the dark matter at the time of recombination. Using {\sc arepo} hydrodynamic simulations we find that the gas densities inside these objects are high enough to allow stars to form. An estimate of the luminosity of the first star clusters formed within these SIGOs suggests that they may be observed at high redshift using future HST and JWST observations. Furthermore, our simulations indicate that SIGOs lie in a distinct place in the luminosity-radius parameter space, which can be used observationally to distinguish SIGOs from dark-matter hosting gas systems. Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we model star formation before reionization and evolve these systems to current times. We find that SIGOs occupy a similar part of the magnitude-radius parameter space as globular clusters. These results suggest that SIGOs may be linked with present-day metal-poor local globular clusters. Since the relative velocity between the baryons and dark matter is coherent over a few Mpc scales, we predict that if this is the dominant mechanism for the formation of globular clusters, their abundance should vary significantly over these scales.

"  Recent breakthroughs in object detection and image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are revolutionizing the state of the art in medical imaging, and microscopy in particular presents abundant opportunities for computer vision algorithms to assist medical professionals in diagnosis of diseases ranging from malaria to cancer. High resolution scans of microscopy slides called Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offer enough information for a cancer pathologist to come to a conclusion regarding cancer presence, subtype, and severity based on measurements of features within the slide image at multiple scales and resolutions. WSIs' extremely high resolutions and feature scales ranging from gross anatomical structures down to cell nuclei preclude the use of standard CNN models for object detection and classification, which have typically been designed for images with dimensions in the hundreds of pixels and with objects on the order of the size of the image itself. We explore parallel approaches based on Reinforcement Learning and Beam Search to learn to progressively zoom into the WSI to detect Regions of Interest (ROIs) in liver pathology slides containing one of two types of liver cancer, namely Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) and Cholangiocarcinoma (CC). These ROIs can then be presented directly to the pathologist to aid in measurement and diagnosis or be used for automated classification of tumor subtype. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Prior work has demonstrated that recurrent neural network architectures show promising improvements over other machine learning architectures when processing temporally correlated inputs, such as wireless communication signals. Additionally, recurrent neural networks typically process data on a sequential basis, enabling the potential for near real-time results. In this work, we investigate the novel usage of ""just enough"" decision making metrics for making decisions during inference based on a variable number of input symbols. Since some signals are more complex than others, due to channel conditions, transmitter/receiver effects, etc., being able to dynamically utilize just enough of the received symbols to make a reliable decision allows for more efficient decision making in applications such as electronic warfare and dynamic spectrum sharing. To demonstrate the validity of this concept, four approaches to making ""just enough"" decisions are considered in this work and each are analyzed for their applicability to wireless communication machine learning applications.

"  We argue that deriving an effective field theory from string theory requires a Wilsonian perspective with a physical cutoff. Employing proper time regularization we demonstrate the decoupling of states and contrast this with what happens in dimensional regularization. In particular we point out that even if the cosmological constant (CC) calculated from some classical action at some ultra-violet scale is negative, this does not necessarily imply that the CC calculated at cosmological scales is also negative, and discuss the possible criteria for achieving a positive CC starting with a CC at the string/KK scale which is negative. Obviously this has implications for swampland claims. ",high energy physics theory
"  The Keldysh formalism is capable of describing driven-dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems as non-unitary effective field theories which are not necessarily thermodynamical, thus often exhibiting new physics. Here we introduce a general Keldysh action that maximally obeys Weinbergian constraints including locality, Poincar\'e invariance, and two ""CPT"" constraints: Complete Positivity and Trace preserving as well as Charge, Parity, and Time reversal symmetry. We find that the perturbative Lindblad term responsible for driven-dissipative dynamics hence introduced has the natural form of a double-trace deformation $\mathcal{O}^2$ which, in the large $N$ limit, possibly leads to a new, non-unitary, and non-thermal conformal fixed point. This fixed-point is IR when $\Delta<d/2$ or UV when $\Delta>d/2$ given $\Delta$ the scaling dimension of $\mathcal{O}$. Such a UV fixed point being not forbidden by Weinbergian constraints may suggest its existence and even completion of itself, in contrast to the commonsense that dissipation effects are always IR-relevant. This observation implies that driven-dissipative dynamics is much richer than thermodynamics, differing in not only its non-compliance with thermodynamic symmetry (e.g., the fluctuation-dissipation relation) but its UV/IR relevance as well. Examples including a $(0+1)$-$d$ harmonic oscillator under continuous measurement and a $(4-\epsilon)$-$d$ classic $O(N)$ vector model with quartic interactions are studied.

"  We propose an empirical method for identifying low damped modes and corresponding mode shapes using frequency measurements from a Wide Area Monitoring System. The method consists of two main steps: Firstly, Complex Principal Component Analysis is used in combination with the Hilbert Transform and Empirical Mode Decomposition to provide estimates of modes and mode shapes. The estimates are stored as multidimensional points. Secondly, the points are grouped using a clustering algorithm, and new averaged estimates of modes and mode shapes are computed as the centroids of the clusters. Applying the method on data resulting from a non-linear power system simulator yields estimates of dominant modes and corresponding mode shapes that are similar to those resulting from modal analysis of the linearized system model. Encouraged by the results, the method is further tested with real PMU data at transmission grid level. Initial results indicate that the performance of the proposed method is promising.

"  Ideal photon-number-resolving detectors form a class of important optical components in quantum optics and quantum information theory. In this article, we theoretically investigate the potential of multiport devices having reconstruction performances approaching that of the Fock-state measurement. By recognizing that all multiport devices are minimally complete, we first provide a general analytical framework to describe the tomographic accuracy (or quality) of these devices. Next, we show that a perfect multiport device with an infinite number of output ports functions as either the Fock-state measurement when photon losses are absent or binomial mixtures of Fock-state measurements when photon losses are present, and derive their respective expressions for the tomographic transfer function. This function is the scaled asymptotic mean squared-error of the reconstructed photon-number distributions uniformly averaged over all distributions in the probability simplex. We then supply more general analytical formulas for the transfer function for finite numbers of output ports in both the absence and presence of photon losses. The effects of photon losses on the photon-number resolving power of both infinite- and finite-size multiport devices are also investigated. ",quantum physics

"  Autonomous vehicles require fleet-wide data collection for continuous algorithm development and validation. The Smart Black Box (SBB) intelligent event data recorder has been proposed as a system for prioritized high-bandwidth data capture. This paper extends the SBB by applying anomaly detection and action detection methods for generalized event-of-interest (EOI) detection. An updated SBB pipeline is proposed for the real-time capture of driving video data. A video dataset is constructed to evaluate the SBB on real-world data for the first time. SBB performance is assessed by comparing the compression of normal and anomalous data and by comparing our prioritized data recording with a FIFO strategy. Results show that SBB data compression can increase the anomalous-to-normal memory ratio by ~25%, while the prioritized recording strategy increases the anomalous-to-normal count ratio when compared to a FIFO strategy. We compare the real-world dataset SBB results to a baseline SBB given ground-truth anomaly labels and conclude that improved general EOI detection methods will greatly improve SBB performance.

Similar decompositions were known for the case of a compact Lie group acting on a space, but our main result applies to discrete, linear and almost connected groups.

Test images of Spica and Jupiter were captured for 28 different telescope configurations, varying aperture separation, aperture diameter, collection wavelength, and exposure time. Lucky imaging was used to account for atmospheric perturbations. Each image was reduced via bias and dark frames to account for sensor noise, and then the full width at half maximum for each image was computed and used as a proxy for maximum angular resolution. The data imply that at small scales aperture size primarily controls the observed maximum angular resolution, but further data are required to substantiate the claim. ",astrophysics

This construction allows us to extend the action of various representation theoretic objects on K(X), such as action of quantum groups, quantum Weyl groups, R-matrices etc., to their action on the K-theory of the variety dual to X. In particular, we relate the wall R-matrices to the R-matrices of the dual variety.   As an example, we apply our results to the Hilbert scheme of n points in the complex plane. In this case we arrive at the conjectures of E.Gorsky and A.Negut. ",mathematics
"  We characterize the conditions under which a multi-time quantum process with a finite temporal resolution can be approximately described by an equilibrium one.

While the same conditions on single-time equilibration, such as a large occupation of energy levels in the initial state remain necessary, we obtain genuine multi-time contributions depending on the temporal resolution of the process and the amount of disturbance of the observer's operations on it.

"  Rabi oscillation, an inter-band oscillation, depicts the periodic flopping between two states that belong to different energy levels in the presence of an oscillatory driving field. In photonics, Rabi oscillation can be mimicked by applying a weak longitudinal periodic modulation to the refractive index change of the system. However, the Rabi oscillation of nonlinear states has yet to be discussed. We report Rabi oscillations of azimuthons---spatially modulated vortex solitons---in weakly nonlinear waveguides with different symmetries, both numerically and theoretically. The period of Rabi oscillation can be determined by applying the coupled mode theory, which largely depends on the modulation strength. Whether the Rabi oscillation between two states can be obtained or not is determined by the spatial symmetry of the azimuthons and the modulating potential. In this paper we succeeded in obtaining the Rabi oscillation of azimuthons in the weakly nonlinear waveguides with different symmetries. Our results not only enrich the Rabi oscillation phenomena, but also provide a new avenue in the study of pattern formation and spatial field manipulation in nonlinear optical systems. ",physics
"  This paper concerns a distributed optimal control problem for a tumor growth model of Cahn-Hilliard type including chemotaxis with possibly singular potentials, where the control and state variables are nonlinearly coupled. First, we discuss the weak well-posedness of the system under very general assumptions for the potentials, which may be singular and nonsmooth. Then, we establish the strong well-posedness of the system in a reduced setting, which however admits the logarithmic potential: this analysis will lay the foundation for the study of the corresponding optimal control problem. Concerning the optimization problem, we address the existence of minimizers and establish both first-order necessary and second-order sufficient conditions for optimality. The mathematically challenging second-order analysis is completely performed here, after showing that the solution mapping is twice continuously differentiable between suitable Banach spaces via the implicit function theorem. Then, we completely identify the second-order Fr\'echet derivative of the control-to-state operator and carry out a thorough and detailed investigation about the related properties. ",mathematics

"  Variable metric proximal gradient methods with different metric selections have been widely used in composite optimization. Combining the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method with a diagonal selection strategy for the metric, the diagonal BB stepsize can keep low per-step computation cost as the scalar BB stepsize and better capture the local geometry of the problem. In this paper, we propose a variable metric mini-batch proximal stochastic recursive gradient algorithm VM-mSRGBB, which updates the metric using a new diagonal BB stepsize. The linear convergence of VM-mSRGBB is established for strongly convex, non-strongly convex and convex functions. Numerical experiments on standard data sets show that VM-mSRGBB is better than or comparable to some variance reduced stochastic gradient methods with best-tuned scalar stepsizes or BB stepsizes. Furthermore, the performance of VM-mSRGBB is superior to some advanced mini-batch proximal stochastic gradient methods. ",mathematics

"  Communication is a crucial phase in the context of distributed training. Because parameter server (PS) frequently experiences network congestion, recent studies have found that training paradigms without a centralized server outperform the traditional server-based paradigms in terms of communication efficiency. However, with the increasing growth of model sizes, these server-free paradigms are also confronted with substantial communication overhead that seriously deteriorates the performance of distributed training. In this paper, we focus on communication efficiency of two serverless paradigms, i.e., Ring All-Reduce (RAR) and gossip, by proposing the Quantized Parallel Restarted Stochastic Gradient Descent (QPRSGD), an algorithm that allows multiple local SGD updates before a global synchronization, in synergy with the quantization to significantly reduce the communication overhead. We establish the bound of accumulative errors according to the synchronization mode and the network topology, which is essential to ensure the convergence property. Under both aggregation paradigms, the algorithm achieves the linear speedup property with respect to the number of local updates as well as the number of workers. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves a convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{NK^2M})$ under the gossip paradigm and outperforms all existing compression methods, where $N$ is the times of global synchronizations, and $K$ is the number of local updates, while $M$ is the number of nodes. An empirical study on various machine learning models demonstrates that the communication overhead is reduced by 90\%, and the convergence speed is boosted by up to 18.6 times, in a low bandwidth network, in comparison with Parallel SGD.

"  Visualization of the in vivo spatial distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) is crucial to biomedicine. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is one of the most promising approaches for direct measurements of the SPION distribution. In this paper, we systematically investigate a single-harmonic-based narrowband MPI approach. Herein, only the 3rd harmonic at 15 kHz of the SPION signal induced in an excitation magnetic field of 5 kHz is measured via a narrowband detection system for imaging during scanning a field-free-point in a field of view. Experiments on spot and line phantoms are performed to evaluate the spatial distribution by the assessment of the full width at half maximum and modulation transfer function at different excitation magnetic fields from 4 to 10 mT. Experimental results demonstrate that reconstructed images have a spatial resolution of 1.6 and 1.5 mm for a gradient field of 2.2 T/m and 4.4 T/m in x- and z-direction, respectively, at an excitation magnetic field of 4 mT. In terms of line gap, two lines with a gap of 0.5 mm are resolved. With increasing the excitation magnetic field to 10 mT, the spatial resolution gets worse to 2.4 and 2.0 mm in x- and z-direction, respectively. Moreover, the custom-built MPI scanner allows a limit of detection of 53 microgram (Fe)/mL (500 ng Fe weight) using perimag SPIONs. In addition, the excellent performance is demonstrated by imaging experiments on an ""emg"" logo phantom. We believe that the proposed narrowband MPI approach is a promising approach for SPION imaging. ",physics

"  Somewhat unexpectedly, the study of the family of twisted knots revealed a hidden structure behind exclusive Racah matrices $\bar S$, which control non-associativity of the representation product in a peculiar channel $R\otimes \bar R \otimes R \longrightarrow R$. These $\bar S$ are simultaneously symmetric and orthogonal, and therefore admit two decompositions: as quadratic forms, $\bar S \sim {\cal E}^{tr}{\cal E}$, and as operators: $\bar T\bar S\bar T = S T^{-1} S^{-1}$. Here $\bar T$ and $T$ consist of the eigenvalues of the quantum ${\cal R}$-matrices in channels $R\otimes \bar R$ and $R\otimes R$ respectively, $S$ is the second exclusive Racah matrix for $\bar R\otimes R\otimes R \longrightarrow R$ (still orthogonal, but no longer symmetric), and ${\cal E}$ is a {\it triangular} matrix. It can be further used to construct the KNTZ evolution matrix ${\cal B}={\cal E}\bar T^2{\cal E}^{-1}$, which is also triangular and explicitly expressible through the skew Schur and Macdonald functions -- what makes Racah matrices calculable. Moreover, ${\cal B}$ is somewhat similar to Ruijsenaars Hamiltonian, which is used to define Macdonald functions, and gets triangular in the Schur basis. Discovery of this pentad structure $(\bar T,\bar S,S,{\cal E},{\cal B})$, associated with the universal ${\cal R}$-matrix, can lead to further insights about representation theory, knot invariants and Macdonald-Kerov functions.

"  Black holes in general relativity are commonly believed to evolve towards a Schwarzschild state as they gradually lose angular momentum and electrical charge under Hawking evaporation. However, when Kim and Wen applied quantum information theory to Hawking evaporation and argued that Hawking particles with maximum mutual information could dominate the emission process, they found that charged black holes tend towards extremality. In view of some evidence pointing towards extremal black holes being effectively singular, this would violate the cosmic censorship conjecture. In this work, we clarified the difference between the two models -- they pertain to two different regimes. By taking into account the discreteness of the charge-to-mass ratio of finite species of charged particles, we also obtained a clearer picture of the end state of Hawking evaporation. We found that in agreement with the weak gravity conjecture, if there is no particle with charge-to-mass ratio q/m>1, stable remnant states are formed, though they are non-extremal. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, we show that extremality can be reached if there exists a particle with q/m<1, even in the presence of other particles with q/m>1. This may explain why there is no charged particle with q/m<1 in the Standard Model of particle physics. Cosmic censorship could thus play a bigger role in fundamental physics than previously thought.

"  The empirical mass-luminosity relation in the Hyades cluster rests on dynamical mass determinations for five binary systems, of which one is eclipsing and the other four are visual or interferometric binaries. The last one was identified and first measured more than 20 years ago. Here we present dynamical mass measurements for a new binary system in the cluster, 80 Tau, which is also a visual pair with a much longer orbital period of about 170 yr. Although we lack the radial-velocity information that has enabled the individual mass determinations in all of the previous binaries, we show that it is still possible to derive the component masses for 80 Tau using only astrometric observations. This is enabled by the accurate proper motion measurements from the Hipparcos and Gaia missions, which constrain the orbital acceleration in the plane of the sky. Separate proper motion values from Gaia for the primary and secondary provide a direct constraint on the mass ratio. Our mass measurements, M(A) = 1.63 (+0.30/-0.13) M(sun) and M(B) = 1.11 (+0.21/-0.14) M(sun), are consistent with the mass-luminosity relation defined by the five previously known systems, which in turn is in good agreement with current models of stellar evolution.

"  We studied the statistical properties of the HI-to-H$_2$ transition observed in absorption in the local diffuse and multiphase ISM to identify the physical processes controlling the probability of occurrence of any line of sight. The turbulent diffuse ISM is modeled using the RAMSES code, which includes detailed treatments of the magnetohydrodynamics, the thermal evolution of the gas, and the chemistry of H$_2$. The impacts of the UV radiation field, the mean density, the turbulent forcing, the integral scale, the magnetic field, and the gravity on the molecular content of the gas are explored through a parametric study covering a wide range of physical conditions. The statistics of the HI-to-H$_2$ transition are interpreted through analytical prescriptions and compared with the observations using a modified and robust version of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results of one simulation, convolved with the distribution of distances of the observational sample, are able to explain most of the statistical properties of the HI-to-H$_2$ transition observed in the local ISM. The tightest agreement is obtained for a neutral diffuse gas modeled over ~200 pc, with a mean density of $1-2$ cm$^{-3}$, illuminated by the standard interstellar UV radiation field, and stirred up by a large-scale compressive turbulent forcing. Within this configuration, the 2D probability histogram of the column densities of H and H$_2$ is remarkably stable and is almost unaltered by gravity, the strength of the turbulent forcing, the resolution of the simulation, or the strength of the magnetic field $B_x$. The weak effect of the resolution and our analytical prescription suggest that the column densities of HI are likely built up in large-scale WNM and CNM structures correlated in density over ~20 pc and ~10 pc, respectively, while those of H$_2$ are built up in CNM structures between ~3 pc and ~10 pc.

"  Dysarthria is a motor speech impairment affecting millions of people. Dysarthric speech can be far less intelligible than those of non-dysarthric speakers, causing significant communication difficulties. The goal of our work is to develop a model for dysarthric to healthy speech conversion using Cycle-consistent GAN. Using 18,700 dysarthric and 8,610 healthy control Korean utterances that were recorded for the purpose of automatic recognition of voice keyboard in a previous study, the generator is trained to transform dysarthric to healthy speech in the spectral domain, which is then converted back to speech. Objective evaluation using automatic speech recognition of the generated utterance on a held-out test set shows that the recognition performance is improved compared with the original dysarthic speech after performing adversarial training, as the absolute WER has been lowered by 33.4%. It demonstrates that the proposed GAN-based conversion method is useful for improving dysarthric speech intelligibility. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Reconstructing under-sampled k-space measurements in Compressed Sensing MRI (CS-MRI) is classically solved with regularized least-squares. Recently, deep learning has been used to amortize this optimization by training reconstruction networks on a dataset of under-sampled measurements. Here, a crucial design choice is the regularization function(s) and corresponding weight(s). In this paper, we explore a novel strategy of using a hypernetwork to generate the parameters of a separate reconstruction network as a function of the regularization weight(s), resulting in a regularization-agnostic reconstruction model. At test time, for a given under-sampled image, our model can rapidly compute reconstructions with different amounts of regularization. We analyze the variability of these reconstructions, especially in situations when the overall quality is similar. Finally, we propose and empirically demonstrate an efficient and data-driven way of maximizing reconstruction performance given limited hypernetwork capacity.

"  We propose an alternative refined de Sitter conjecture. It is given by a natural condition on a combination of the first and second derivatives of the scalar potential. We derive our conjecture in the same weak coupling, semi-classical regime where the previous refined de Sitter conjecture was derived, using the same tools together with a few more assumptions that we discuss. We further test and constrain free parameters in our conjecture using data points of a classical type IIA supergravity setup. Interestingly, our conjecture easily accommodates slow-roll single field inflation with a concave potential, favored by observations. The standard quintessence potential is in tension with our new conjecture, and we thus propose a different type of quintessence model. ",high energy physics theory

Furthermore, for well-chosen initial data, we also show the lower bounds on the decay rates.

"  In massless QCD coupled to QED in an external magnetic field, a photon with the linear polarization in the direction of the external magnetic field mixes with the charge neutral pion through the triangle anomaly, leading to one gapless mode with the quadratic dispersion relation $\omega \sim k^2$ and one gapped mode. We show that this gapless mode can be interpreted as the so-called type-B Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of generalized global symmetries and that its presence is solely dictated by the anomalous commutator in the symmetry algebra. We also argue a possible realization of such nonrelativistic NG modes in 3-dimensional Dirac semimetals. ",high energy physics theory

"  Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) play an important role in many statistics and machine learning applications ranging from support vector machines to Gaussian processes and kernel embeddings of distributions. Operators acting on such spaces are, for instance, required to embed conditional probability distributions in order to implement the kernel Bayes rule and build sequential data models. It was recently shown that transfer operators such as the Perron-Frobenius or Koopman operator can also be approximated in a similar fashion using covariance and cross-covariance operators and that eigenfunctions of these operators can be obtained by solving associated matrix eigenvalue problems. The goal of this paper is to provide a solid functional analytic foundation for the eigenvalue decomposition of RKHS operators and to extend the approach to the singular value decomposition. The results are illustrated with simple guiding examples. ",mathematics
"  The 1-D mean-field equation describing the evolution of the subsurface toroidal field can be used together with the observed surface radial field to model the subsurface toroidal flux density. We aim to test this model and determine the relationship between the observationally inferred surface toroidal field (as a proxy for flux emergence), and the modelled subsurface toroidal flux density. We use a combination of sunspot area observations, the surface toroidal field inferred from WSO line-of-sight magnetic field observations, and compare with the results of a 1-D mean-field evolution equation for the subsurface toroidal field, driven by the observed radial field from the National Solar Observatory/Kitt Peak and SOLIS observations. We derive calibration curves relating the subsurface toroidal flux density to the observed surface toroidal field strengths and sunspot areas. The calibration curves are for two regimes, one corresponding to ephemeral region emergence outside of the butterfly wings, the other to active region emergence in the butterfly wings. We discuss this in terms of the size and vertical velocity associated with the two types of flux emergence. ",astrophysics

"  It is usually assumed that the field isotope shift (FIS) is completely determined by the change of the averaged squared values of the nuclear charge radius $\langle r^2\rangle$. Relativistic corrections modify the expression for FIS, which is actually described by the change of $\langle r^{2 \gamma}\rangle$, where $\gamma=\sqrt{1 - Z^2 \alpha^2}$. In the present paper we consider corrections to FIS which are due to the nuclear deformation and due to the predicted reduced charge density in the middle of the superheavy nuclei produced by a very strong proton repulsion (hole in the nuclear centre). Specifically, we investigate effects which can not be completely reduced to the change of $\langle r^2 \rangle$ or $\langle r^{2 \gamma}\rangle$. ",physics
"  Simultaneous processing of multiple video sources requires each pixel in a frame from a video source to be processed synchronously with the pixels at the same spatial positions in corresponding frames from the other video sources. However, simultaneous processing is challenging as corresponding frames from different video signals provided by multiple sources have time-varying delay because of the electrical and mechanical restrictions inside the video sources hardware that cause deviation in the corresponding frame rates. Researchers overcome the aforementioned challenges either by utilizing ready-made video processing systems or designing and implementing a custom system tailored to their specific application. These video processing systems lack flexibility in handling different applications requirements such as the required number of video sources and outputs, video standards, or frame rates of the input/output videos. In this paper, we present a design for a flexible simultaneous video processing architecture that is suitable for various applications. The proposed architecture is upgradeable to deal with multiple video standards, scalable to process/produce a variable number of input/output videos, and compatible with most video processors. Moreover, we present in details the analog/digital mixed-signals and power distribution considerations used in designing the proposed architecture. As a case study application of the proposed flexible architecture, we utilized the architecture for a realization of a simultaneous video processing system that performs video fusion from visible and near-infrared video sources in real time.

"  In this contribution a numerical model is developed to study the time dynamics of photoluminescence emitted by Tb3+ doped multimode chalcogenide-selenide glass fibers pumped by laser light at approximately 2 microns. The model consists of a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), which describe the temporal and spatial evolution of the photon density and level populations within the fiber. In order to solve numerically the PDEs a Method of Lines is applied. The modeling parameters are extracted from measurements and from data available in the literature. The numerical results obtained support experimental observations. In particular, the developed model reproduces the discrepancies that are observed between the photoluminescence decay curves obtained from different points along the fiber. The numerical analysis is also used to explain the source of these discrepancies. ",physics
"  The corona is a key component of most luminous accreting black holes, carrying 5 - 30 % of the power and in non-jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), creating all the X-ray emission above $\simeq 1-2$ keV. Its emission illuminates the inner accretion disc, creating the atomic line-rich reflection spectrum used to diagnose and map the accretion flow and measure black hole spin. The corona is likely powered magnetically by the strong differential rotation of the accretion disc and it may be intimately related to relativistic jets. Recent work shows that many black hole coronae may be dominated by electron-positron pairs produced by photon-photon collisions in the compact coronal environment. Despite the corona being an integral component of AGN and black hole binary systems, much is still unknown about the nature of the corona, such as its geometry, location, and the physical mechanisms powering the emission. In this white paper we explore our current understanding of coronal properties, such as its temperature, obtained from measurements with existing hard X-ray telescopes such as NuSTAR, and discuss important questions to be addressed in the coming decade surrounding the nature of the corona. Hard X-ray observations will continue to dispel the mystery of coronae and open up this part of the quasar engine to full understanding. ",astrophysics
"  Engineering problems are often characterized by significant uncertainty in their material parameters. A typical example coming from geotechnical engineering is the slope stability problem where the soil's cohesion is modeled as a random field. An efficient manner to account for this uncertainty is the novel sampling method called p-refined Multilevel Quasi-Monte Carlo (p-MLQMC). The p-MLQMC method uses a hierarchy of p-refined Finite Element meshes combined with a deterministic Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling rule. This combination yields a significant computational cost reduction with respect to classic Multilevel Monte Carlo. However, in previous work, not enough consideration was given how to incorporate the uncertainty, modeled as a random field, in the Finite Element model with the p-MLQMC method. In the present work we investigate how this can be adequately achieved by means of the integration point method. We therefore investigate how the evaluation points of the random field are to be selected in order to obtain a variance reduction over the levels. We consider three different approaches. These approaches will be benchmarked on a slope stability problem in terms of computational runtime. We find that the Local Nested Approach yields a speedup up to a factor five with respect to the Non-Nested approach. ",mathematics

A dedicated facility based on conventional accelerator techniques and existing infrastructures designed to overcome these impediments would have a remarkable impact on the entire field of neutrino oscillation physics.

"  We study the star-forming (SF) population of galaxies within a sample of 209 IR-selected galaxy clusters at 0.3$\,\leq\,z\,\leq\,$1.1 in the ELAIS-N1 and XMM-LSS fields, exploiting the first HSC-SSP data release. The large area and depth of these data allows us to analyze the dependence of the SF fraction, $f_{SF}$, on stellar mass and environment separately. Using $R/R_{200}$ to trace environment, we observe a decrease in $f_{SF}$ from the field towards the cluster core, which strongly depends on stellar mass and redshift. The data show an accelerated growth of the quiescent population within the cluster environment: the $f_{SF}$ vs. stellar mass relation of the cluster core ($R/R_{200}\,\leq\,$0.4) is always below that of the field (4$\,\leq\,R/R_{200}\,<\,$6). Finally, we find that environmental and mass quenching efficiencies depend on galaxy stellar mass and distance to the center of the cluster, demonstrating that the two effects are not separable in the cluster environment. We suggest that the increase of the mass quenching efficiency in the cluster core may emerge from an initial population of galaxies formed ``in situ.'' The dependence of the environmental quenching efficiency on stellar mass favors models in which galaxies exhaust their reservoir of gas through star formation and outflows, after new gas supply is truncated when galaxies enter the cluster.

"  We estimate the mass of the intermediate-mass black hole at the heart of the dwarf elliptical galaxy NGC 404 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the molecular interstellar medium at an unprecedented linear resolution of ~0.5 pc, in combination with existing stellar kinematic information. These ALMA observations reveal a central disc/torus of molecular gas clearly rotating around the black hole. This disc is surrounded by a morphologically and kinematically complex flocculent distribution of molecular clouds, that we resolve in detail. Continuum emission is detected from the central parts of NGC 404, likely arising from the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of emission from dust around the nucleus, and potentially from dusty massive star-forming clumps at discrete locations in the disc. Several dynamical measurements of the black hole mass in this system have been made in the past, but they do not agree. We show here that both the observed molecular gas and stellar kinematics independently require a ~5x10$^5$ Msun black hole once we include the contribution of the molecular gas to the potential. Our best estimate comes from the high-resolution molecular gas kinematics, suggesting the black hole mass of this system is 5.5$^{+4.1}_{-3.8}\times$10$^5$ Msun (at the 99% confidence level), in good agreement with our revised stellar kinematic measurement and broadly consistent with extrapolations from the black hole mass - velocity dispersion and black hole mass - bulge mass relations. This highlights the need to accurately determine the mass and distribution of each dynamically important component around intermediate-mass black holes when attempting to estimate their masses.

Deep learning has achieved great success in computer aided diagnosis (CADx) area for lung cancer, whereas it suffers from label ambiguity due to the difficulty in the radiological diagnosis.

"  This paper considers the liveness enforcement problem in a class of Petri nets (PNs) modeling distributed systems called Synchronized Sequential Processes (SSP). This class of PNs is defined as a set of mono-marked state machines (sequential machines, called also agents) cooperating in a distributed way through buffers. These buffers could model intermediate products in a production system or information channel in a healthcare system but they should be destination private to an agent. The designed controller for liveness enforcement should preserve this important property characteristic to the distributed systems. The approach in this paper is based on the construction of a control PN that is an abstraction of the relations of the T-semiflows and buffers. The control PN will evolve in parallel with the system, avoiding the firing of transitions that may lead the system to livelock. An algorithm to compute this control PN is presented. Moreover, in order to ensure the liveness of control PN, another algorithm is proposed allowing the firing of local T-semiflow in the correct proportion.

"  The question of the existence of gravitational stress-energy in general relativity has exercised investigators in the field since the inception of the theory. Folklore has it that no adequate definition of a localized gravitational stress-energetic quantity can be given. Most arguments to that effect invoke one version or another of the Principle of Equivalence. I argue that not only are such arguments of necessity vague and hand-waving but, worse, are beside the point and do not address the heart of the issue. Based on a novel analysis of what it may mean for one tensor to depend in the proper way on another, which, \emph{en passant}, provides a precise characterization of the idea of a `geometric object', I prove that, under certain natural conditions, there can be no tensor whose interpretation could be that it represents gravitational stress-energy in general relativity. It follows that gravitational energy, such as it is in general relativity, is necessarily non-local. Along the way, I prove a result of some interest in own right about the structure of the associated jet bundles of the bundle of Lorentz metrics over spacetime. I conclude by showing that my results also imply that, under a few natural conditions, the Einstein field equation is the unique equation relating gravitational phenomena to spatiotemporal structure, and discuss how this relates to the non-localizability of gravitational stress-energy. The main theorem proven underlying all the arguments is considerably stronger than the standard result in the literature used for the same purposes (Lovelock's theorem of 1972): it holds in all dimensions (not only in four); it does not require an assumption about the differential order of the desired concomitant of the metric; and it has a more natural physical interpretation.

"  Chemically tagging stars back to common formation sites in the Milky Way and establishing a high level of chemical homogeneity in these chemically-tagged birth clusters is important for understanding the chemical and dynamical history of the Galactic disc. We constrain the intrinsic abundance scatter in 17 newly chemically-tagged dissolved birth clusters found in the APOGEE survey by modeling APOGEE spectra as a one-dimensional function of initial stellar mass, performing forward modeling of the observed stellar spectra, and comparing the data and simulations using Approximate Bayesian Computation. We test this method on the well-known open clusters M67, NGC 6819, NGC 7789, and NGC 6791. We study 15 elements in APOGEE and find that, in general, we are able to obtain very strong constraints on the intrinsic abundance scatter of most elements in the chemically-tagged birth clusters, with upper limits of <~ 0.02 dex for C, <~ 0.03 dex for O, Mn, and Fe, <~ 0.04 dex for Si and Ni, and <~ 0.05 dex for N, Mg, and Ca. While we find some evidence for a small amount of chemical inhomogeneity in the remaining elements (i.e. Na, Al, S, K, Ti, and V), we are still able to obtain stronger limits compared to those found for open clusters, consistent with previous findings. By strongly constraining the level of chemical homogeneity within reconstructed birth clusters, we can strengthen the statement that these groups of stars represent birth clusters, with promising implications for future chemical tagging studies.

"  In this article, we investigate Reeb dynamics on $b^m$-contact manifolds, previously introduced in [MiO], which are contact away from a hypersurface $Z$ but satisfy certain transversality conditions on $Z$. The study of these contact structures is motivated by that of contact manifolds with boundary. The search of periodic Reeb orbits on those manifolds thereby starts with a generalization of the well-known Weinstein conjecture. Contrary to the initial expectations, examples of compact $b^m$-contact manifolds without periodic Reeb orbits outside $Z$ are provided. Furthermore, we prove that in dimension $3$, there are always infinitely many periodic orbits on the critical set if it is compact. We prove that traps for the $b^m$-Reeb flow exist in any dimension. This investigation goes hand-in-hand with the Weinstein conjecture on non-compact manifolds having compact ends of convex type. In particular, we extend Hofer's arguments to open overtwisted contact manifolds that are $\mathbb R^+$-invariant in the open ends, obtaining as a corollary the existence of periodic $b^m$-Reeb orbits away from the critical set. The study of $b^m$-Reeb dynamics is motivated by well-known problems in fluid dynamics and celestial mechanics, where those geometric structures naturally appear. In particular, we prove that the dynamics on positive energy level-sets in the restricted planar circular three-body problem are described by the Reeb vector field of a $b^3$-contact form that admits an infinite number of periodic orbits at the critical set.

"  Flux ratio anomalies in strong gravitationally lensed quasars constitute a unique way to probe the abundance of non-luminous dark matter haloes, and hence the nature of dark matter. In this paper we identify double imaged quasars as a statistically efficient probe of dark matter, since they are 20 times more abundant than quadruply imaged quasars. Using N-body simulations that include realistic baryonic feedback, we measure the full distribution of flux ratios in doubly imaged quasars for cold (CDM) and warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies. Through this method, we fold in two key systematics - quasar variability and line-of-sight structures. We find that WDM cosmologies predict a ~6 per cent difference in the cumulative distribution functions of flux ratios relative to CDM, with CDM predicting many more small ratios. Finally, we estimate that ~600 doubly imaged quasars will need to be observed in order to be able to unambiguously discern between CDM and the two WDM models studied here. Such sample sizes will be easily within reach of future large scale surveys such as Euclid. In preparation for this survey data we require discerning the scale of the uncertainties in modelling lens galaxies and their substructure in simulations, plus a strong understanding of the selection function of observed lensed quasars.

Then, we compute the corresponding modified cosmological radius and express the black hole electric charge in terms of this modified cosmological radius and, thus, in terms of the generalized uncertainty principle parameter.

"  In this paper, we introduce a class of nonsmooth nonconvex least square optimization problem using convex analysis tools and we propose to use the iterative minimization-majorization (MM) algorithm on a convex set with initializer away from the origin to find an optimal point for the optimization problem. For this, first we use an approach to construct a class of convex majorizers which approximate the value of non-convex cost function on a convex set. The convergence of the iterative algorithm is guaranteed when the initial point $x^{(0)}$ is away from the origin and the iterative points $x^{(k)}$ are obtained in a ball centred at $x^{(k-1)}$ with small radius. The algorithm converges to a stationary point of cost function when the surregators are strongly convex.

By an adequate selection of the number of modes of the original infinite-dimensional system, we show that the design performed on the finite-dimensional truncated model achieves the exponential stabilization of the original infinite-dimensional system. In the presence of distributed disturbances, we show that the closed-loop system is exponentially input-to-state stable with fading memory. ",mathematics
"  'Rich get richer' rule comforts previously often chosen actions. What is happening to the evolution of individual inclinations to choose an action when agents do interact ? Interaction tends to homogenize while each individual dynamics tends to reinforce its own position. Interacting stochastic systems of reinforced processes were recently considered in many papers, where the asymptotic behavior was proven to exhibit a.s. synchronization. We consider in this paper models where, even if interaction among agents is present, absence of synchronization may happen due to the choice of an individual non-linear reinforcement. We show how these systems can naturally be considered as models for coordination games, technological or opinion dynamics. ",mathematics
"  The conditions leading to flat dispersionless frequency bands in truly one-dimensional parity-time ($\cal PT$) symmetric metamaterials comprising split-ring resonators (SRRs) arranged in a binary pattern are obtained analytically. In this paradigmatic system, in which the SRRs are coupled through both electric and magnetic dipole-dipole forces, flat-bands may arise from tailoring its natural parameters (such as, e.g., the coupling coefficients between SRRs) and not from geometrical effects. For sets of parameters which values are tailored to flatten the upper band of the spectrum, the solution of the corresponding quadratic eigenvalue problem reveals the existence of compact, two-site localized eigenmodes. Numerical simulations confirm the existence and the dynamic stability of such modes, which can be formed through the evolution of single-site initial excitations without disorder or nonlinearity.

"  Scalar effective field theories with enhanced soft limits behave in many ways like gauge theories and gravity. In particular, symmetries fix the structure of interactions and the tree-level S-matrix in both types of theories. We explore how this analogy persists in the presence of matter by considering theories with additional fields coupled to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scalar or the special galileon in a way that is consistent with their symmetries. Using purely on-shell arguments, we show that these theories obey analogues of the S-matrix equivalence principle whereby all matter fields must couple to the DBI scalar or the special galileon through a particular quartic vertex with a universal coupling. These equivalence principles imply the universality of the leading double soft theorems in these theories, which are scalar analogues of Weinberg's gravitational soft theorem, and can be used to rule out interactions with massless higher-spin fields when combined with analogues of the generalized Weinberg-Witten theorem. We verify in several examples that amplitudes with external matter fields nontrivially exhibit enhanced single soft limits and we show that such amplitudes can be constructed using soft recursion relations when they have sufficiently many external DBI or special galileon legs, including amplitudes with massive higher-spin fields. As part of our analysis we construct a recently conjectured special galileon-vector effective field theory. ",high energy physics theory
"  The $b$-ghost of the pure spinor formalism in a general curved background is not holomorphic. For such theories, the construction of the string measure requires the knowledge of the action of diffeomorphisms on the BV phase space. We construct such an action for the pure spinor sigma-model in $AdS_5\times S^5$. From the point of view of the BV formalism, this sigma-model belongs to the class of theories where the expansion of the Master Action in antifields terminates at the quadratic order. We show that it can be reduced to a simpler degenerate sigma-model, preserving the AdS symmetries. We construct the action of the algebra of worldsheet vector fields on the BV phase space of this minimalistic sigma-model, and explain how to lift it to the original model.

"  There are two basic angles associated with a pair of linear subspaces: the Diximier angle and the Friedrichs angle. These classical notions, which date back to the first half of the 20th century, have been thoroughly studied due to their utility in the description of convergence rates for various projection-based algorithms for solving feasibility problems.   The Dixmier angle of the pair of orthogonal complements is the same as the Dixmier angle of the original pair provided that the original pair gives rise to a direct (not necessarily orthogonal) sum of the underlying Hilbert space. Even more satisfyingly, the Friedrichs angles of the original pair and the pair of the orthogonal complements always coincide. These two beautiful results are due to Krein, Krasnoselskii, and Milman and to Solmon, respectively. In 1995, Deutsch provided a very nice survey with complete proofs and interesting historical comments. One key result in Deutsch's survey was an inequality for Dixmier angles provided by Hundal.   In this paper, we present extensions of these results to the case when the linear subspaces are only required to be convex cones. It turns out that Hundal's result has a nice conical extension while the situation is more technical for the results by Krein et al. and by Solmon. Our analysis is based on Deutsch's survey and our recent work on angles between convex sets. Throughout, we also provide examples illustrating the sharpness of our results. ",mathematics

Then, a simple projectively flat bundle $E(L,\mathcal{L})\rightarrow X^n$ is constructed from each affine Lagrangian submanifold $L$ in $\check{X}^n$ with a unitary local system $\mathcal{L} \rightarrow L$. In this paper, we first interpret these simple projectively flat bundles $E(L,\mathcal{L})$ in the language of factors of automorphy. Furthermore, we give a geometric interpretation for exact triangles consisting of three simple projectively flat bundles $E(L,\mathcal{L})$ and their shifts by focusing on the dimension of intersections of the corresponding affine Lagrangian submanifolds $L$.

MACHO 80.7443.1718 is a young (${\sim}6$~Myr), massive binary, composed of a B0 Iae supergiant with $M_1 \simeq 35 M_\odot$ and an O9.5V secondary with $M_2 \simeq 16 M_\odot$ on an eccentric ($e=0.51\pm0.03$) orbit.

The B[e] supergiant has Balmer emission lines and permitted/forbidden metallic emission lines associated with a circumstellar disk. The disk rapidly dissipates at periastron which could indicate mass transfer to the secondary, but re-emerges immediately following periastron passage.

"  We study different aspects of quantum field theory at finite density using methods from quantum information theory. For simplicity we focus on massive Dirac fermions with nonzero chemical potential, and work in $1+1$ space-time dimensions. Using the entanglement entropy on an interval, we construct an entropic $c$-function that is finite. Unlike what happens in Lorentz-invariant theories, this $c$-function exhibits a strong violation of monotonicity; it also encodes the creation of long-range entanglement from the Fermi surface. Motivated by previous works on lattice models, we next calculate numerically the Renyi entropies and find Friedel-type oscillations; these are understood in terms of a defect operator product expansion. Furthermore, we consider the mutual information as a measure of correlation functions between different regions. Using a long-distance expansion previously developed by Cardy, we argue that the mutual information detects Fermi surface correlations already at leading order in the expansion. We also analyze the relative entropy and its Renyi generalizations in order to distinguish states with different charge and/or mass. In particular, we show that states in different superselection sectors give rise to a super-extensive behavior in the relative entropy. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to interacting theories, and argue for the relevance of some of these measures for probing non-Fermi liquids. ",high energy physics theory
"  Many characteristics of dwarf carbon stars are broadly consistent with a binary origin, including mass transfer from an evolved companion. While the population overall appears to have old-disc or halo kinematics, roughly 2$\,$per cent of these stars exhibit H$\alpha$ emission, which in low-mass main-sequence stars is generally associated with rotation and relative youth. Its presence in an older population therefore suggests either irradiation or spin-up. This study presents time-series analyses of photometric and radial-velocity data for seven dwarf carbon stars with H$\alpha$ emission. All are shown to have photometric periods in the range 0.2--5.2$\,$d, and orbital periods of similar length, consistent with tidal synchronisation. It is hypothesised that dwarf carbon stars with emission lines are the result of close-binary evolution, indicating that low-mass, metal-weak or metal-poor stars can accrete substantial material prior to entering a common-envelope phase.

"  Ninety per cent of baryons are located outside galaxies, either in the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium. Theory points to galactic winds as the primary source of the enriched and massive circumgalactic medium. Winds from compact starbursts have been observed to flow to distances somewhat greater than ten kiloparsecs, but the circumgalactic medium typically extends beyond a hundred kiloparsecs. Here we report optical integral field observations of the massive but compact galaxy SDSS J211824.06+001729.4.

We also observe neutral gas phases at temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvin reaching distances of 20 kiloparsecs and velocities of around 1,500 kilometres per second. This multi-phase outflow is probably driven by bursts of star formation, consistent with theory. ",astrophysics
"  Shear-wave elastography (SWE) measures shear-wave speed (SWS), which is related to the underlying shear modulus of soft tissue. SWE methods generally assume that soft tissue viscoelasticity is independent of mechanical loading, however, soft tissues are known to have viscoelasticity changing nonlinearly with pre-compression. Hence, characterization by SWS alone is insufficient, where nonlinear properties can be seen as confounders but may also be utilized as additional bio-markers. The viscoelastic nature of a medium is fully characterized by its storage and loss moduli, which are related to SWS and shear-wave attenuation (SWA). In this work, we study SWA characteristics as a function of applied strain to measure nonlinear viscoelastic parameters in soft tissues. For this purpose, we apply incremental quasi-static compression on the samples while measuring SWS and SWA, from which we derive storage and loss moduli to estimate nonlinear viscoelastic parameters as a function of applied strain using acoustoelasticity (AE) theory. Results from tissue-mimicking phantoms with varying oil percentages and ex-vivo porcine liver experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. In both these experiments, SWA was observed to decrease with applied strain. For 10 % compression in ex-vivo livers, shear-wave attenuation decreased on average by 28 % (93 Np/m), while SWS increased on average by 20 % (0.26 m/s). ",physics
"  If holography is an equivalence between quantum theories, one might expect it to be described by a map that is a bijective isometry between bulk and boundary Hilbert spaces, preserving the hamiltonian and symmetries. Holography has been believed to be a property of gravitational (or string) theories, but not of non-gravitational theories; specifically Marolf has argued that it originates from the gauge symmetries and constraints of gravity. These observations suggest study of the assumed holographic map as a function of the gravitational coupling $G$. The zero coupling limit gives ordinary quantum field theory, and is therefore not necessarily expected to be holographic. This, and the structure of gravity at non-zero $G$, raises important questions about the full map. In particular, construction of a holographic map appears to require as input a solution of the nonperturbative analog of the bulk gravitational constraints, that is, the unitary bulk evolution. Moreover, examination of the candidate boundary algebra, including the boundary hamiltonian, reveals commutators that don't close in the usual fashion expected for a boundary theory.

"  We consider the circuit complexity of free bosons, or equivalently free fermions, in 1+1 dimensions. Motivated by the results of [1] and [2, 3] who found different behavior in the complexity of free bosons and fermions, in any dimension, we consider the 1+1 dimensional case where, thanks to the bosonisation equivalence, we can consider the same state from both the bosonic and the fermionic perspectives. In this way the discrepancy can be attributed to a different choice of the set of gates allowed in the circuit. We study the effect in two classes of states: i) bosonic-coherent / fermionic-gaussian states; ii) states that are both bosonic- and fermionic-gaussian. We consider the complexity relative to the ground state. In the first class, the different results can be reconciled admitting a mode-dependent cost function in one of the descriptions. The differences in the second class are more important, in terms of the cutoff-dependence and the overall behavior of the complexity. ",high energy physics theory

In addition to providing a new conceptual framework and a mathematically solid setting, this allows us to uncover interesting and novel effects.

"  We develop algorithms and techniques to compute rigorous bounds for finite pieces of orbits of the critical points, for intervals of parameter values, in the quadratic family of one-dimensional maps $f_a (x) = a - x^2$. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by constructing a dynamically defined partition $\mathcal P$ of the parameter interval $\Omega=[1.4, 2]$ into almost 4 million subintervals, for each of which we compute to high precision the orbits of the critical points up to some time $N$ and other dynamically relevant quantities, several of which can vary greatly, possibly spanning several orders of magnitude. We also subdivide $\mathcal P$ into a family $\mathcal P^{+}$ of intervals which we call stochastic intervals and a family $\mathcal P^{-}$ of intervals which we call regular intervals. We numerically prove that each interval $\omega \in \mathcal P^{+}$ has an escape time, which roughly means that some iterate of the critical point taken over all the parameters in $\omega$ has considerable width in the phase space. This suggests, in turn, that most parameters belonging to the intervals in $\mathcal P^{+}$ are stochastic and most parameters belonging to the intervals in $\mathcal P^{-}$ are regular, thus the names. We prove that the intervals in $\mathcal P^{+}$ occupy almost 90% of the total measure of $\Omega$.

The ideas and procedures can be easily generalized to apply to other parametrized families of dynamical systems. ",mathematics
"  Due to the inverse Primakoff effect it has been shown that when axions interact with a DC magnetic B-field the resulting electrical action will produce an AC electromotive force which oscillates at the Compton frequency of the axion, and may be modeled as an oscillating effective impressed magnetic current boundary source. We use this result to calculate the sensitivity of new experiments to low-mass axions using the quasi-static technique. First, we calculate the current induced in an electric dipole antenna (straight conducting wire) when the DC B-field is spatially constant and show that it has a sensitivity proportional to the axion mass. Following this we extend the topology by making use of the full extent of the spatially varying DC B-field. This extension is achieved by transforming the 1D conducting wire to a 2D winding, to fully link the effective magnetic current boundary source and thus couple to the full axion induced electrical action. In this case the conductor becomes a coil winding where the voltage induced across the winding increases proportionally to the number of windings. We investigate two different topologies: The 1st uses a single winding, and couples to the effective short circuit current generated in the winding, which is read out using a sensitive low impedance SQUID amplifier: The 2nd uses multiple windings, with every turn effectively increasing the the voltage output proportional to the winding number. The read out of this configuration is optimised by implementing a cryogenic low-noise high input impedance voltage amplifier. The end result is a new Broadband Electrical Action Sensing Techniques with orders of magnitude improved sensitivity, which is linearly proportional to the axion photon coupling and capable of detecting QCD dark matter axions.

"  MRI with multiple protocols is commonly used for diagnosis, but it suffers from a long acquisition time, which yields the image quality vulnerable to say motion artifacts. To accelerate, various methods have been proposed to reconstruct full images from under-sampled k-space data. However, these algorithms are inadequate for two main reasons. Firstly, aliasing artifacts generated in the image domain are structural and non-local, so that sole image domain restoration is insufficient. Secondly, though MRI comprises multiple protocols during one exam, almost all previous studies only employ the reconstruction of an individual protocol using a highly distorted undersampled image as input, leaving the use of fully-sampled short protocol (say T1) as complementary information highly underexplored. In this work, we address the above two limitations by proposing a Dual Domain Recurrent Network (DuDoRNet) with deep T1 prior embedded to simultaneously recover k-space and images for accelerating the acquisition of MRI with a long imaging protocol. Specifically, a Dilated Residual Dense Network (DRDNet) is customized for dual domain restorations from undersampled MRI data. Extensive experiments on different sampling patterns and acceleration rates demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and can reconstruct high-quality MRI.

"  Orbital monitoring of exoplanetary and stellar systems is fundamental for analysing their architecture, dynamical stability and evolution, and mechanisms of formation. Current high-contrast extreme-adaptive optics imagers like SPHERE, GPI, and SCExAO+CHARIS explore the population of giant exoplanets and brown dwarf and stellar companions beyond typically 10 au, covering generally a small fraction of the orbit (<20%) leading to degeneracies and biases in the orbital parameters. Precise and robust measurements over time of the position of the companions are critical, which require good knowledge of the instrumental limitations and dedicated observing strategies. The homogeneous dedicated calibration strategy for astrometry implemented for SPHERE has facilitated high-precision studies by its users since its start of operation in 2014.

"  Speaker segmentation consists in partitioning a conversation between one or more speakers into speaker turns. Usually addressed as the late combination of three sub-tasks (voice activity detection, speaker change detection, and overlapped speech detection), we propose to train an end-to-end segmentation model that does it directly. Inspired by the original end-to-end neural speaker diarization approach (EEND), the task is modeled as a multi-label classification problem using permutation-invariant training. The main difference is that our model operates on short audio chunks (5 seconds) but at a much higher temporal resolution (every 16ms). Experiments on multiple speaker diarization datasets conclude that our model can be used with great success on both voice activity detection and overlapped speech detection. Our proposed model can also be used as a post-processing step, to detect and correctly assign overlapped speech regions.

This operator serves as the fundamental part of an iterative numerical solver. However, their mapping is improperly justified. The present article proves that their mapping is indeed a proximal operator, and also derives its proper counterpart. Furthermore, it is rationalized that Lieb and Stark's operator can be understood as an approximation of the proper mapping. Surprisingly, in most cases, such an approximation (referred to as the approximal operator) is shown to provide even better numerical results in audio inpainting compared to its proper counterpart, while being computationally much more effective.

However, when dealing with anisotropic materials, an approximation is conducted and leads to an unsatisfactory error. Here we develop a modified perturbation theory for small shifts in anisotropically dielectric interfaces. By using optimized smoothing function for each component of permittivity, we obtain a method to calculate the intrinsic frequency shifts of anisotropic permittivity field when boundaries shift, without approximation. Our method shows accurate results when calculating eigenfrequency's shifts in strong-anisotropy materials, and can be widely used for small shifts in anisotropically dielectric interfaces. ",physics
"  We develop an algebraic framework for ribbon graphs, revealing symmetry properties of (partial) twisted duality. The original ribbon group action of Ellis-Monaghan and Moffatt restricts self-duality, -petriality, or -triality to the canonical identification of a graph's edges with those of its dual, petrial, or trial, whereas the more natural definition allows any isomorphism. Here we define a new ribbon group action on ribbon graphs, using a semidirect product of the original ribbon group with a permutation group, to take (partial) twists and duals of ribbon graphs while also encoding graph isomorphisms. This brings new algebraic tools to bear on the natural definitions of self-duality etc., as a ribbon graph is a fixed point of this new ribbon group action exactly when it is isomorphic to one of its (partial) twisted duals. With these tools, we prove that every ribbon graph has in its orbit an orientable embedded bouquet, whose (partial) twisted duality properties propagate through the orbit. Thus, (partial) twisted duality properties of all embedded graphs may be analyzed through such bouquets, for which checking isomorphism reduces to checking just dihedral group symmetries. Previous research on self-duality, etc., typically focused on highly symmetric regular maps, but the theory here fully encompasses all cellularly embedded graphs. In contrast to the few, large, very high-genus, self-trial regular maps found by Wilson, and by Jones and Poultin, here we apply our framework to generate all self-trial ribbon graphs on up to seven edges. We also show how a graph's automorphism group may be used to find self-dual, etc., graphs in its orbit, thus exposing the relationship between regularity and the ribbon group action and, answering a question of Jones and Poulton, yielding an infinite family of self-trial graphs not arising as covers or parallel connections of regular maps.

"  It is known that one can define a consistent theory of extended, $N=2$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) Supergravity (SUGRA) in $D=4$. Besides the standard gravitational part, this theory involves a single $U(1)$ gauge field and a pair of Majorana vector-spinors that can be mixed into a pair of charged spin-$3/2$ gravitini. The action for $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA is invariant under $SO(1,3)\times U(1)$ gauge transformations, and under local SUSY. We present a geometric action that involves two ""inhomogeneous"" parts: an orthosymplectic $OSp(4\vert 2)$ gauge-invariant action of the Yang-Mills type, and a supplementary action invariant under purely bosonic $SO(2,3)\times U(1)\sim Sp(4)\times SO(2)$ sector of $OSp(4\vert 2)$, that needs to be added for consistency. This action reduces to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA after gauge fixing, for which we use a constrained auxiliary field in the manner of Stelle and West. Canonical deformation is performed by using the Seiberg-Witten approach to noncommutative (NC) gauge field theory with the Moyal product. The NC-deformed action is expanded in powers of the deformation parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ up to the first order. We show that $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA has non-vanishing linear NC correction in the physical gauge, originating from the additional, purely bosonic action. For comparison, simple $N=1$ Poinacar\'{e} SUGRA can be obtained in the same manner, directly from an $OSp(4\vert 1)$ gauge-invariant action. The first non-vanishing NC correction is quadratic in $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ and therefore exceedingly difficult to calculate. Under Wigner-In\""{o}n\""{u} (WI) contraction, $N=2$ AdS superalgebra reduces to $N=2$ Poincar\'{e} superalgebra, and it is not clear whether this relation holds after canonical deformation. We present the linear NC correction to $N=2$ $AdS_{4}$ SUGRA explicitly, discuss its low-energy limit, and what remains of it after WI contraction. ",high energy physics theory
"  Very massive 140-260 Msun stars can die as highly-energetic pair-instability supernovae (PI SNe) with energies of up to 100 times those of core-collapse SNe that can completely destroy the star, leaving no compact remnant behind. These explosions can synthesize $0.1-30$ Msun of radioactive Ni56, which can cause them to rebrighten at later times when photons due to Ni56 decay diffuse out of the ejecta. However, heat from the decay of such large masses of Ni56 could also drive important dynamical effects deep in the ejecta that are capable of mixing elements and affecting the observational signatures of these events. We have now investigated the dynamical effect of Ni56 heating on PI SN ejecta with high-resolution two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations performed with the CASTRO code. We find that expansion of the hot Ni56 bubble forms a shell at the base of the silicon layer of the ejecta about 200 days after the explosion but that no hydrodynamical instabilities develop that would mix Ni56 with the Si/O-rich ejecta. However, while the dynamical effects of Ni56 heating may be weak they could affect the observational signatures of some PI SNe by diverting decay energy into internal expansion of the ejecta at the expense of rebrightening at later times.

Also, the presence of the string cloud with the sufficiently large density should prevent the the existence of the critical temperature. As increasing the string cloud density parameter, the critical temperature decreases in the region of the sufficiently low charge density but increases in the region of the sufficiently high charge density. Whereas, the presence of Gauss-Bonnet terms always makes the critical temperature decreasing.

"  The chemical evolution of fluorine is investigated in a sample of Milky Way red giantstars that span a significant range in metallicity from [Fe/H] $\sim$ -1.3 to 0.0 dex. Fluorine abundances are derived from vibration-rotation lines of HF in high-resolution infraredspectra near $\lambda$ 2.335 $\mu$m. The red giants are members of the thin and thick disk / halo,with two stars being likely members of the outer disk Monoceros overdensity. At lowermetallicities, with [Fe/H]<-0.4 to -0.5, the abundance of F varies as a primary element with respect to the Fe abundance, with a constant subsolar value of [F/Fe] $\sim$ -0.3 to -0.4 dex. At larger metallicities, however, [F/Fe] increases rapidly with [Fe/H] anddisplays a near-secondary behavior with respect to Fe. Comparisons with various models of chemical evolution suggest that in the low-metallicity regime (dominated hereby thick disk stars), a primary evolution of $^{19}$F with Fe, with a subsolar [F/Fe] valuethat roughly matches the observed plateau can be reproduced by a model incorporatingneutrino nucleosynthesis in the aftermath of the core collapse in supernovae of type II (SN II). A primary behavior for [F/Fe] at low metallicity is also observed for a model including rapid rotating low-metallicity massive stars but this overproduces [F/Fe] atlow metallicity. The thick disk red giants in our sample span a large range of galactocentric distance (Rg $\sim$ 6--13.7 kpc), yet display a $\sim$constant value of [F/Fe], indicating a very flat gradient (with a slope of 0.02 $\pm$ 0.03 dex/kpc) of this elemental ratio over asignificant portion of the Galaxy having|Z|>300 pc away from the Galaxy mid-plane.

  To describe dynamics of bulk and fluctuations near the QCD critical point we develop general relativistic fluctuation formalism for a fluid carrying baryon charge. Feedback of fluctuations modifies hydrodynamic coefficients including bulk viscosity and conductivity and introduces nonlocal and non-instantaneous terms in constitutive equations. We perform necessary ultraviolet (short-distance) renormalization to obtain cutoff independent deterministic equations suitable for numerical implementation. We use the equations to calculate the universal non-analytic small-frequency dependence of transport coefficients due to fluctuations (long-time tails). Focusing on the critical mode we show how this general formalism matches existing Hydro+ description of fluctuations near the QCD critical point and nontrivially extends it inside and outside of the critical region. ,high energy physics theory

"  Recently the renormalization of the band gap $m$, in both WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$, has been experimentally measured as a function of the carrier concentration $n$. The main result establishes a decreasing of hundreds of meV, in comparison with the bare band gap, as the carrier concentration increases. These materials are known as transition metal dichalcogenides and their low-energy excitations are, approximately, described by the massive Dirac equation. Using Pseudo Quantum Electrodynamics (PQED) to describe the electromagnetic interaction between these quasiparticles and from renormalization group analysis, we obtain that the renormalized mass describes the band gap renormalization with a function given by $m(n)/m_0=(n/n_0)^{C_\lambda/2}$, where $m_0=m(n_0)$ and $C_\lambda$ is a function of the coupling constant $\lambda$. We compare our theoretical results with the experimental findings for WSe$_2$ and MoS$_2$, and we conclude that our approach is in agreement with these experimental results for reasonable values of $\lambda$. In addition we introduced a Gross-Neveu (GN) interaction which could simulate an disorder/impurity-like microscopic interaction. In this case, we show that there exists a critical coupling constant, namely, $\lambda_c \approx 0,66$ in which the beta function of the mass vanishes, providing a stable fixed point in the ultraviolet limit. For $\lambda>\lambda_c$, the renormalized mass decreases while for $\lambda<\lambda_c$ it increases with the carrier concentration. ",high energy physics theory

"  Most neutron stars are expected to be born in supernovae, but only about half of supernova remnants (SNRs) are associated with a compact object. In many cases, a supernova progenitor may have resulted in a black hole. However, there are several possible reasons why true pulsar-SNR associations may have been missed in previous surveys: The pulsar's radio beam may not be oriented towards us; the pulsar may be too faint to be detectable; or there may be an offset in the pulsar position caused by a kick. Our goal is to find new pulsars in SNRs and explore their possible association with the remnant. The search and selection of the remnants presented in this paper was inspired by the non-detection of any X-ray bright compact objects in these remnants when previously studied. Five SNRs were searched for radio pulsars with the Green Bank Telescope at 820 MHz with multiple pointings to cover the full spatial extent of the remnants. A periodicity search plus an acceleration search up to 500 m/s^2 and a single pulse search were performed for each pointing in order to detect potential isolated binary pulsars and single pulses, respectively. No new pulsars were detected in the survey. However, we were able to re-detect a known pulsar, PSR J2047+5029, near SNR G89.0+4.7. We were unable to detect the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2021+4026, but we do find a flux density limit of 0.08 mJy. Our flux density limits make our survey two to 16 times more sensitive than previous surveys, while also covering the whole spatial extent of the same remnants. We discuss potential explanations for the non-detection of a pulsar in the studied SNRs and conclude that sensitivity is still the most likely factor responsible for the lack of pulsars in some remnants.

"  Within the so-called cosmological collider program, imprints of new particles on primordial non-Gaussianities have been studied intensively. In particular, their non-analytic features in the soft limit provide a smoking gun for new particles at the inflation scale. While this approach is very powerful to probe particles of the mass near the Hubble scale, the signal is exponentially suppressed for heavy particles. In this paper, to enlarge the scope of the cosmological collider, we explore a new approach to probing spins of heavy particles from signs of Wilson coefficients of the inflaton effective action and the corresponding primordial non-Gaussianities. As a first step, we focus on the regime where the de Sitter conformal symmetry is weakly broken. It is well known that the leading order effective operator $(\partial_\mu\phi\partial^\mu\phi)^2$ is universally positive as a consequence of unitarity. In contrast, we find that the sign of the six derivative operator $(\nabla_\mu\partial_\nu\phi)^2(\partial_\rho\phi)^2$ is positive for intermediate heavy scalars, whereas it is negative for intermediate heavy spinning states. Therefore, under the assumption of tree-level UV completion, the sign can be used to probe spins of heavy particles generating the effective interaction. We also study phenomenology of primordial non-Gaussianities thereof. ",high energy physics theory
"  Inconsistent conclusions are obtained from recent active galactic nuclei (AGNs) accretion disk inter-band time-lag measurements. While some works show that the measured time lags are significantly larger (by a factor of $\sim 3$) than the theoretical predictions of the Shakura \& Sunyaev disk (SSD) model, others find that the time-lag measurements are consistent with (or only slightly larger than) that of the SSD model. These conflicting observational results might be symptoms of our poor understanding of AGN accretion physics. Here we show that sources with larger-than-expected time lags tend to be less-luminous AGNs. Such a dependence is unexpected if the inter-band time lags are attributed to the light-travel-time delay of the illuminating variable X-ray photons to the static SSD. If, instead, the measured inter-band lags are related not only to the static SSD but also to the outer broad emission-line regions (BLRs; e.g., the blended broad emission lines and/or diffuse continua), our result indicates that the contribution of the non-disk BLR to the observed UV/optical continuum decreases with increasing luminosity ($L$), i.e., an anti-correlation resembling the well-known Baldwin effect. Alternatively, we argue that the observed dependence might be a result of coherent disk thermal fluctuations as the relevant thermal timescale, $\tau_{\mathrm{TH}}\propto L^{0.5}$. With future accurate measurements of inter-band time lags, the above two scenarios can be distinguished by inspecting the dependence of inter-band time lags upon either the BLR components in the variable spectra or the timescales.

"  Electric Network Frequency (ENF) fluctuations constitute a powerful tool in multimedia forensics. An efficient approach for ENF estimation is introduced with temporal windowing based on the filter-bank Capon spectral estimator. A type of Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix is used due to the Toeplitz structure of the covariance matrix. Moreover, this approach uses, for the first time in the field of ENF, a temporal window, not necessarily the rectangular one, at the stage preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices are employed for fast implementation of matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in ENF estimation, when a short time window of $1$ second is employed in power recordings. In speech recordings, the proposed approach yields highly accurate results with respect to both time complexity and accuracy. Moreover, the impact of different temporal windows is studied. The results show that even the most trivial methods for ENF estimation, such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform, can provide better results than the most recent state-of-the-art methods, when a temporal window is employed. The correlation coefficient is used to measure the ENF estimation accuracy. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Artifacts are a common occurrence in Diffusion MRI (dMRI) scans. Identifying and removing them is essential to ensure the accuracy and viability of any post processing carried out on these scans. This makes QC (quality control) a crucial first step prior to any analysis of dMRI data. Several QC methods for artifact detection exist, however they suffer from problems like requiring manual intervention and the inability to generalize across different artifacts and datasets. In this paper, we propose an automated deep learning (DL) pipeline that utilizes a 3D-Densenet architecture to train a model on diffusion volumes for automatic artifact detection. Our method is applied on a vast dataset consisting of 9000 volumes sourced from 7 large clinical datasets. These datasets comprise scans from multiple scanners with different gradient directions, high and low b values, single shell and multi shell acquisitions. Additionally, they represent diverse subject demographics like the presence or absence of pathologies. Our QC method is found to accurately generalize across this heterogenous data by correctly detecting 92% artifacts on average across our test set. This consistent performance over diverse datasets underlines the generalizability of our method, which currently is a significant barrier hindering the widespread adoption of automated QC techniques. For these reasons, we believe that 3D-QCNet can be integrated in diffusion pipelines to effectively automate the arduous and time-intensive process of artifact detection.

The theory possesses a reach set of coupling constants, including the scalar terms with odd powers of scalar fields in the potential, and constants of non-minimal coupling of the scalar fields to gravity. Using the heat-kernel technique and dimensional regularization, we derive the one-loop divergences, describe the renormalization of the theory under consideration and calculate the full set of beta- and gamma-functions for all coupling constants and fields. As a next step, we construct the renormalized one-loop effective potential of the scalar fields up to the terms linear in scalar curvature. This calculation includes only the contributions from quantum scalar fields, and is performed using covariant cut-off regularization and local momentum representation. Some difficulties of the renormalization group approach to the effective potential in the case under consideration are discussed. ",high energy physics theory
"  Visual cryptography encrypts the secret image into $n$ shares (transparency) so that only stacking a qualified number of shares can recover the secret image by the human visual system while no information can be revealed without a large enough number of shares. This paper investigates the $(k,n)$-threshold Visual Secret Sharing (VSS) model, where one can decrypt the original image by stacking at least $k$ shares and get nothing with less than $k$ shares. There are two main approaches in the literature: codebook-based schemes and random-grid-based schemes; the former is the case of this paper. In general, given any positive integers $k$ and $n$, it is not easy to design a valid scheme for the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS model. In this paper, we propose a simple strategy to construct an efficient scheme for the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS model for any positive integers $2\leq k\leq n$. The crucial idea is to establish a seemingly unrelated connection between the $(k,n)$-threshold VSS scheme and a mathematical structure -- the generalized Pascal's triangle. This paper improves and extends previous results in four aspects: Our construction offers a unified viewpoint and covers several known results;   The resulting scheme has a progressive-viewing property that means the more shares being stacked together the clearer the secret image would be revealed.   The proposed scheme can be constructed explicitly and efficiently based on the generalized Pascal's triangle without a computer. Performance of the proposed scheme is comparable with known results.

"  In this paper, we introduce quotients of exact categories by percolating subcategories. This approach extends earlier localization theories by Cardenas and Schlichting for exact categories, allowing new examples. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a percolating subcategory of an exact category $\mathcal{E}$, the quotient $\mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A}$ is constructed in two steps. In the first step, we associate a set $S_\mathcal{A} \subseteq \operatorname{Mor}(\mathcal{E})$ to $\mathcal{A}$ and consider the localization $\mathcal{E}[S^{-1}_\mathcal{A}]$. In general, $\mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}]$ need not be an exact category, but will be a one-sided exact category. In the second step, we take the exact hull $\mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A}$ of $\mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{E}^{-1}]$. The composition $\mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}[S_\mathcal{A}^{-1}] \rightarrow \mathcal{E} {/\mkern-6mu/} \mathcal{A}$ satisfies the 2-universal property of a quotient in the 2-category of exact categories.   We formulate our results in slightly more generality, allowing to start from a one-sided exact category. Additionally, we consider a type of percolating subcategories which guarantee that the morphisms of the set $S_\mathcal{A}$ are admissible.   In upcoming work, we show that these localizations induce Verdier localizations on the level of the bounded derived category. ",mathematics

"  We report the discovery of the third tidally tilted pulsator, TIC 63328020. Observations with the TESS satellite reveal binary eclipses with an orbital period of 1.1057 d, and $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations with a mode frequency of 21.09533 d$^{-1}$. This pulsation exhibits a septuplet of orbital sidelobes as well as a harmonic quintuplet. Using the oblique pulsator model, the primary oscillation is identified as a sectoral dipole mode with $l = 1, |m| = 1$. We find the pulsating star to have $M_1 \simeq 2.5\, {\rm M}_\odot$, $R_1 \simeq 3 \, {\rm R}_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,1} \simeq 8000$ K, while the secondary has $M_2 \simeq 1.1 \, {\rm M}_\odot$, $R_2 \simeq 2 \, {\rm R}_\odot$, and $T_{\rm eff,2} \simeq 5600$ K. Both stars appear to be close to filling their respective Roche lobes. The properties of this binary as well as the tidally tilted pulsations differ from the previous two tidally tilted pulsators, HD74423 and CO Cam, in important ways. We also study the prior history of this system with binary evolution models and conclude that extensive mass transfer has occurred from the current secondary to the primary. ",astrophysics
"  Tomita-Takesaki modular theory provides a set of algebraic tools in quantum field theory that is suitable for the study of the information-theoretic properties of states. For every open set in spacetime and choice of two states, the modular theory defines a positive operator known as the relative modular operator that decreases monotonically under restriction to subregions. We study the consequences of this operator monotonicity inequality for correlation functions in quantum field theory. We do so by constructing a one-parameter Renyi family of information-theoretic measures from the relative modular operator that inherit monotonicity by construction and reduce to correlation functions in special cases. In the case of finite quantum systems, this Renyi family is the sandwiched Renyi divergence and we obtain a new simple proof of its monotonicity. Its monotonicity implies a class of constraints on correlation functions in quantum field theory, only a small set of which were known to us. We explore these inequalities for free fields and conformal field theory. We conjecture that the second null derivative of Renyi divergence is non-negative which is a generalization of the quantum null energy condition to the Renyi family. ",high energy physics theory
"  We introduce the notion of corresponding a chemical reaction network to a split network translation, and use this novel process to extend the scope of existing network-based theory for characterizing the steady state set of mass-action systems. In the process of network splitting, the reactions of a network are divided into subnetworks, called slices, in such a way that, when summed across the slices, the stoichiometry of each reaction sums to that of the original network. This can produce a network with more desirable structural properties, such as weak reversibility and a lower deficiency, which can then be used to establish steady state properties of the original mass-action system such as multistationarity and absolute concentration robustness. We also present a computational implementation utilizing mixed-integer linear programming for determining whether a given chemical reaction network has a weakly reversible split network translation.

"  In this reply we clarify the main points of our manuscript and respond to the critique in the Comment arXiv:2002.11514. In particular, we emphasize that our conclusion ""squeezing loses effectiveness in the deep quantum regime"" does not contradict the previous work arXiv:1801.10383, but instead adds to it, and raises fundamental questions on classifying parameter regimes for quantum synchronization. Moreover, we address the concern brought up on the validity of the master equation in the deep quantum regime, and show that our noise-enhanced synchronization differs from previous literature. Through numerical examples, we also demonstrate that the choice of ansatz, while appearing inconsistent, does not lead to erroneous conclusions. Lastly, we expound on the physics of noise-boosted synchronization, and show that it is indeed a genuine feature unique to the deep quantum regime. However, we note that single photon dissipation is a more accurate term, and will move to using that. ",quantum physics

"  We obtained linear polarization photometry ($J$-band) and low-resolution spectroscopy ($ZJ$-bands) of Trappist-1, which is a planetary system formed by an M8-type low-mass star and seven temperate, Earth-sized planets. The photopolarimetric monitoring campaign covered 6.5 h of continuous observations including one full transit of planet Trappist-1d and partial transits of Trappist-1b and e. The spectrophotometric data and the photometric light curve obtained over epochs with no planetary transits indicate that the low-mass star has very low level of linear polarization compatible with a null value. However, the ""in transit"" observations reveal an enhanced linear polarization signal with peak values of $p^* = 0.1\,\%$ with a confidence level of 3 $\sigma$, particularly for the full transit of Trappist-1d, thus confirming that the atmosphere of the M8-type star is very likely dusty. Additional observations probing different atmospheric states of Trappist-1 are needed to confirm our findings, as the polarimetric signals involved are low. If confirmed, polarization observations of transiting planetary systems with central ultra-cool dwarfs can become a powerful tool for the characterization of the atmospheres of the host dwarfs and the validation of transiting planet candidates that cannot be corroborated by any other method.

"  This paper studies stability properties of multi-cluster formations in Kuramoto networks with adaptive coupling. Sufficient conditions for the local asymptotic stability of the corresponding synchronization invariant toroidal manifold are derived and formulated in terms of the intra-cluster interconnection topology and plasticity parameters of the adaptive couplings. The proposed sufficient stability conditions qualitatively mimic certain counterpart results for Kuramoto networks with static coupling which require sufficiently strong and dense intra-cluster connections and sufficiently weak and sparse inter-cluster ones. Remarkably, the existence of cluster formations depends on the interconnection structure between nodes belonging to different clusters and does not require any coupling links between nodes that form a cluster. On the other hand, the stability properties of clusters depend on the interconnection structure inside the clusters. This dependence constitutes the main contribution of the paper. Also, two numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed theoretical findings. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Mars' polar layered deposits (PLD) are comprised of layers of varying dust-to-water ice volume mixing ratios (VMR) that may record astronomically-forced climatic variation over Mars' recent orbital history. Retracing the formation of these layers by quantifying the sensitivity of deposition rates of polar material to astronomical forcing is critical for the interpretation of this record. Using a Mars global climate model (GCM), we investigate the sensitivity of annual polar water ice and dust surface deposition to various obliquities and surface water ice distributions at zero eccentricity, providing a reasonable characterization of the evolution of the PLD during recent low-eccentricity epochs. For obliquities between 15{\deg} - 35{\deg}, predicted net annual accumulation rates range from -1 to +14 mm/yr for water ice and from +0.003 to +0.3 mm/yr for dust. GCM-derived rates are ingested into an integration model that simulates polar accumulation of water ice and dust over 5 consecutive obliquity cycles (~700 kyrs) during a low eccentricity epoch. A subset of integration simulations predict combined accumulation of water ice and dust in the north at time averaged rates that are near the observationally-inferred value of 0.5 mm/yr. Three types of layers are produced per obliquity cycle: a ~30 m-thick dust-rich (~25% dust VMR) layer forms at high obliquity, a ~0.5 m-thick dust lag forms at low obliquity, and two ~10 m-thick dust-poor (~3%) layers form when obliquity is increasing/decreasing. The ~30 m-thick dust-rich layer is reminiscent of a ~30 m feature derived from visible imagery analysis the north PLD, while the ~0.5 m-thick dust lag is a factor of ~2 smaller than observed ""thin layers"". Overall, this investigation provides further evidence for obliquity forcing in the PLD climate record, and demonstrates the importance of ice-on-dust nucleation in polar depositional processes.

"  We study the relationship between the tensor product multiplicities of a compact semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and a special function $\mathcal{J}$ associated to $\mathfrak{g}$, called the volume function. The volume function arises in connection with the randomized Horn's problem in random matrix theory and has a related significance in symplectic geometry. Building on box spline deconvolution formulae of Dahmen-Micchelli and De Concini-Procesi-Vergne, we develop new techniques for computing the multiplicities from $\mathcal{J}$, answering a question posed by Coquereaux and Zuber. In particular, we derive an explicit algebraic formula for a large class of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients in terms of $\mathcal{J}$. We also give analogous results for weight multiplicities, and we show a number of further identities relating the tensor product multiplicities, the volume function and the box spline. To illustrate these ideas, we give new proofs of some known theorems. ",mathematics
"  Optimal Power Flow (OPF) can be modeled as a non-convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP). Our purpose is to solve OPF to global optimality. To this end, we specialize the Mixed-Integer Quadratic Convex Reformulation method (MIQCR) to (OPF). This is a method in two steps. First, a Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) relaxation of (OPF) is solved. Then the optimal dual variables of this relaxation are used to reformulate OPF into an equivalent new quadratic program, where all the non-convexity is moved to one additional constraint. In the second step, this reformulation is solved within a branch-and-bound algorithm, where at each node a quadratic and convex relaxation of the reformulated problem, obtained by relaxing the non-convex added constraint, is solved. The key point of our approach is that the lower bound at the root node of the branch-and-bound tree is equal to the SDP relaxation value. We test this method on several OPF cases, from two-bus networks to more-than-a-thousand-buses networks from the MAT-POWER repository. Our first results are very encouraging. ",mathematics

"  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem of augmenting distance-based formation controllers with a secondary constraint for the purpose of preventing 3D formation ambiguities. Specifically, we introduce three controlled variables that form an orthogonal space and uniquely characterize a tetrahedron formation in 3D. This orthogonal space incorporates constraints on the inter-agent distances and the signed volume of tetrahedron substructures. The formation is modeled using a directed graph with a leader-follower type configuration and single-integrator dynamics. We show that the proposed decentralized formation controller ensures the \textit{global} asymptotic stability and the local exponential stability of the desired formation for an \textit{n}-agent system with no ambiguities. Unlike previous work, this result is achieved without conditions on the tetrahedrons that form the desired formation or on the control gains. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Moreover, we prove that the rectilinear shock waves are never violently unstable, i.e., they are always either uniformly or weakly stable. ",mathematics

"  We propose a model in which dividend payments occur at regular, deterministic intervals in an otherwise continuous model. This contrasts traditional models where either the payment of continuous dividends is controlled or the dynamics are given by discrete time processes. Moreover, between two dividend payments, the structure allows for other types of control; we consider the possibility of equity issuance at any point in time. The value is characterized as the fixed point of an optimal control problem with periodic initial and terminal conditions. We prove the regularity and uniqueness of the corresponding dynamic programming equation, and the convergence of an efficient numerical algorithm that we use to study the problem. The model enables us to find the loss caused by infrequent dividend payments. We show that under realistic parameter values this loss varies from around 1% to 24% depending on the state of the system, and that using the optimal policy from the continuous problem further increases the loss.

"  It is well established that magnetic free energy associated with electric currents powers solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from solar active regions (ARs). However, the conditions that determine whether an AR will produce an eruption are not well understood. Previous work suggests that the degree to which the driving electric currents, or the sum of all currents within a single magnetic polarity, are neutralized may serve as a good proxy for assessing the ability of ARs to produce eruptions. Here, we investigate the relationship between current neutralization and flare/CME production using a sample of 15 flare-active and 15 flare-quiet ARs. All flare-quiet and 4 flare-active ARs are also CME-quiet. We additionally test the relation of current neutralization to the degree of shear along polarity inversion lines (PILs) in an AR. We find that flare-productive ARs are more likely to exhibit non-neutralized currents, specifically those that also produce a CME. We find that flare/CME-active ARs also exhibit higher degrees of PIL shear than flare/CME-quiet ARs. We additionally observe that currents become more neutralized during magnetic flux emergence in flare-quiet ARs. Our investigation suggests that current neutralization in ARs is indicative of their eruptive potential. ",astrophysics
"  Celestial amplitudes represent 4D scattering of particles in boost, rather than the usual energy-momentum, eigenstates and hence are sensitive to both UV and IR physics. We show that known UV and IR properties of quantum gravity translate into powerful constraints on the analytic structure of celestial amplitudes. For example the soft UV behavior of quantum gravity is shown to imply that the exact four-particle scattering amplitude is meromorphic in the complex boost weight plane with poles confined to even integers on the negative real axis. Would-be poles on the positive real axis from UV asymptotics are shown to be erased by a flat space analog of the AdS resolution of the bulk point singularity. The residues of the poles on the negative axis are identified with operator coefficients in the IR effective action. Far along the real positive axis, the scattering is argued to grow exponentially according to the black hole area law. Exclusive amplitudes are shown to simply factorize into conformally hard and conformally soft factors. The soft factor contains all IR divergences and is given by a celestial current algebra correlator of Goldstone bosons from spontaneously broken asymptotic symmetries. The hard factor describes the scattering of hard particles together with the boost-eigenstate clouds of soft photons or gravitons required by asymptotic symmetries. These provide an IR safe $\mathcal{S}$-matrix for the scattering of hard particles. ",high energy physics theory
"  We study Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with positive cosmological constant as a model for de Sitter quantum gravity. We focus on the quantum mechanics of the model at past and future infinity. There is a Hilbert space of asymptotic states and an infinite-time evolution operator between the far past and far future. This evolution is not unitary, although we find that it acts unitarily on a subspace up to non-perturbative corrections. These corrections come from processes which involve changes in the spatial topology, including the nucleation of baby universes. There is significant evidence that this 1+1 dimensional model is dual to a 0+0 dimensional matrix integral in the double-scaled limit. So the bulk quantum mechanics, including the Hilbert space and approximately unitary evolution, emerge from a classical integral. We find that this emergence is a robust consequence of the level repulsion of eigenvalues along with the double scaling limit, and so is rather universal in random matrix theory.

"  We develop a novel dynamical method to examine spatial interaction models (SIMs). For each SIM, we use our dynamical framework to model emigration patterns. We look at the resulting population distributions to see if they are realistic or not. We use the US census data from 2010 and various spatial statistics to access the success or failure of each model. While we looked at over eighty different SIMs, we will focus here on two examples: the production constrained gravity model and the Radiation model. The results suggest that all these models fail to produce realistic population distributions and we identify the flaws within existing models. This leads us to suggest that we should define site attractiveness in terms of a second short range SIM leading to a new spatial interaction model - the Two-Trip model - which offers significant improvements when examined via our method. We also note that our Two-Trip adaptation can be used in any spatial modelling contexts, not just emigration. ",physics

For the phonon cooling, an order of magnitude improvement could be achieved.

Such a PT-synthetic metachannel shows the capability to produce a high-directivity leaky radiation, with a beam angle that can be altered by varying the gain-loss parameter.

"  We explore the origin of stellar metallicity gradients in simulated and observed dwarf galaxies. We use FIRE-2 cosmological baryonic zoom-in simulations of 26 isolated galaxies as well as existing observational data for 10 Local Group dwarf galaxies. Our simulated galaxies have stellar masses between $10^{5.5}$ and $10^{8.6} \msun$. Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady ""puffing"" of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the ""puffing"" process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects. ",astrophysics
"  In this paper we address the $W^{1,1}$-continuity of several maximal operators at the gradient level. A key idea in our global strategy is the decomposition of a maximal operator, with the absence of strict local maxima in the disconnecting set, into ""lateral"" maximal operators with good monotonicity and convergence properties. This construction is inspired in the classical sunrise lemma in harmonic analysis. A model case for our sunrise strategy considers the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $\widetilde{M}$ acting on $W^{1,1}_{\rm rad}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, the subspace of $W^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ consisting of radial functions. In dimension $d\geq 2$ it was recently established by H. Luiro that the map $f \mapsto \nabla \widetilde{M} f$ is bounded from $W^{1,1}_{\rm rad}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$, and we show that such map is also continuous. Further applications of the sunrise strategy in connection with the $W^{1,1}$-continuity problem include non-tangential maximal operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ acting on radial functions when $d\geq 2$ and general functions when $d=1$, and the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$ acting on polar functions when $d\geq 2$ and general functions when $d=1$.

"  Unsteady fluid systems are nonlinear high-dimensional dynamical systems that may exhibit multiple complex phenomena both in time and space. Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) of fluid flows has been an active research topic in the recent decade with the primary goal to decompose complex flows to a set of features most important for future state prediction and control, typically using a dimensionality reduction technique. In this work, a novel data-driven technique based on the power of deep neural networks for reduced order modeling of the unsteady fluid flows is introduced. An autoencoder network is used for nonlinear dimension reduction and feature extraction as an alternative for singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, the extracted features are used as an input for long short-term memory network (LSTM) to predict the velocity field at future time instances. The proposed autoencoder-LSTM method is compared with non-intrusive reduced order models based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Moreover, an autoencoder-DMD algorithm is introduced for reduced order modeling, which uses the autoencoder network for dimensionality reduction rather than SVD rank truncation. Results show that the autoencoder-LSTM method is considerably capable of predicting fluid flow evolution, where higher values for coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ are obtained using autoencoder-LSTM compared to other models.

"  The entropic force and the imaginary part of potential experienced by a moving quarkonia in a plasma, are computed in a charged deformed AdS background by holography approaches. In that case, the axis of the moving quarkonia has an arbitrary angle with wind. We show that the charge in deformed AdS background deeply effect on the increasing entropic force and decreasing thermal width. So, the dissociation length of the meson becomes short when charge is increasing. In addition, the entropic force and thermal width are increased by the deformation of the space. Therefore the deformation parameter in such background leads us to find process with arbitrary dissociation length of quark- anti quark. ",high energy physics theory

"  In this paper, we will consider a cosmological model with two topological transitions of the space. The smooth 4-dimensional spacetime of the model admits topological transitions of its 3-dimensional slices. The whole approach is inspired by a class of exotic smoothness structure on $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$. In particular, this class of smoothness structures induces two topological transitions. Then, we are able to calculate the energy scales as associated to these topological transitions. For the first transition we will get the value of the GUT scale and the energy of the second transition is at the electroweak scale. The topology of the exotic $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$ determines both, the energy of the scales by certain topological invariants, and the existence of the right-handed sterile neutrino. It is the input for the seesaw mechanism. Secondly, based on this model, we are able to calculate the neutrino masses which are in a very good agreement with experiments. Finally, we will speculate, again based on topology, why there are three generations of neutrinos and an asymmetry between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. ",high energy physics theory

"  We present a method for the fast computation of the eigenpairs of a bijective positive symmetric linear operator $\mathcal{L}$. The method is based on a combination of operator adapted wavelets (gamblets) with hierarchical subspace correction.First, gamblets provide a raw but fast approximation of the eigensubspaces of $\mathcal{L}$ by block-diagonalizing $\mathcal{L}$ into sparse and well-conditioned blocks. Next, the hierarchical subspace correction method, computes the eigenpairs associated with the Galerkin restriction of $\mathcal{L}$ to a coarse (low dimensional) gamblet subspace, and then, corrects those eigenpairs by solving a hierarchy of linear problems in the finer gamblet subspaces (from coarse to fine, using multigrid iteration). The proposed algorithm is robust for the presence of multiple (a continuum of) scales and is shown to be of near-linear complexity when $\mathcal{L}$ is an (arbitrary local, e.g.~differential) operator mapping $\mathcal{H}^s_0(\Omega)$ to $\mathcal{H}^{-s}(\Omega)$ (e.g.~an elliptic PDE with rough coefficients).

"  The most general operator product expansion in conformal field theory is obtained using the embedding space formalism and a new uplift for general quasi-primary operators. The uplift introduced here, based on quasi-primary operators with spinor indices only and standard projection operators, allows a unified treatment of all quasi-primary operators irrespective of their Lorentz group irreducible representations. This unified treatment works at the level of the operator product expansion and hence applies to all correlation functions. A very useful differential operator appearing in the operator product expansion is established and its action on appropriate products of embedding space coordinates is explicitly computed. This computation leads to tensorial generalizations of the usual Exton function for all correlation functions. Several important identities and contiguous relations are also demonstrated for these new tensorial functions. From the operator product expansion all correlation functions for all quasi-primary operators, irrespective of their Lorentz group irreducible representations, can be computed recursively in a systematic way. The resulting answer can be expressed in terms of tensor structures that carry all the Lorentz group information and linear combinations of the new tensorial functions. Finally, a summary of the well-defined rules allowing the computation of all correlation functions constructively is presented. ",high energy physics theory

"  A novel scheme is proposed for generating a polarized positron beam via multiphoton Breit-Wheeler process during the collision of a 10 GeV, pC seeding electron beam with the other 1 GeV, nC driving electron beam.

First, we separate Puiseux monoids according to their density in $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$, and we characterize monoids in each of these classes in terms of generating sets and sets of irreducibles. Then we study the density of the difference group, the root closure, and the conductor semigroup of a Puiseux monoid. Finally, we prove that every Puiseux monoid generated by a strictly increasing sequence of rationals is nowhere dense in $\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ and has empty conductor. ",mathematics
"  Short gamma-ray bursts that are followed by long-duration X-ray plateaus may be powered by the birth, and hydrodynamic evolution, of magnetars from compact binary coalescence events. If the rotation and magnetic axes of the system are not orthogonal to each other, the star will undergo free precession, leading to fluctuations in the luminosity of the source. In some cases, precession-induced modulations in the spin-down power may be discernible in the X-ray flux of the plateau. In this work, 25 X-ray light curves associated with bursts exhibiting a plateau are fitted to luminosity profiles appropriate for precessing, oblique rotators. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion, 16 (64 per cent) of the magnetars within the sample display either moderate or strong evidence for precession. Additionally, since the precession period of the star is directly tied to its quadrupolar ellipticity, the fits allow for an independent measure of the extent to which the star is deformed by internal stresses. Assuming these deformations arise due to a mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic field, we find that the distribution of magnetic-energy ratios is bimodal, with data points clustering around energetically equal and toroidally dominated partitions. Implications of this result for gravitational-wave emission and dynamo activity in newborn magnetars are discussed. ",astrophysics

"  Relative drifts between different species or particle populations are characteristic to solar plasma outflows, e.g., in the fast streams of the solar winds, coronal mass ejections and interplanetary shocks. This paper characterizes the dispersion and stability of the low-beta alpha/proton drifts in the absence of any intrinsic thermal anisotropies, which are usually invoked in order to stimulate various instabilities. The dispersion relations derived here describe the full spectrum of instabilities and their variations with the angle of propagation and plasma parameters. The results unveil a potential competition between instabilities of the electromagnetic proton cyclotron and alpha cyclotron modes. For conditions specific to a low-beta solar wind, e.g., at low heliocentric distances in the outer corona, the instability operates on the alpha cyclotron branch. The growth rates of the alpha cyclotron mode are systematically stimulated by the (parallel) plasma beta and/or the alpha-proton temperature ratio. One can therefore expect that this instability develops even in the absence of temperature anisotropies, with potential to contribute to a self-consistent regulation of the observed drift of alpha particles.

"  So far, only transient Gravitational waves (GWs) produced by catastrophic events of extra-galactic origin have been detected. However, it is generally believed that there should be also continuous sources of GWs within our galaxy, such as accreting neutron stars (NSs). In fact, in accreting NSs, centrifugal forces can be so strong to break the neutron star crust (causing a starquake), thus producing a quadrupole moment responsible for the continuous emission of GWs. At equilibrium, the angular momentum gained by accretion and lost via GWs emission should balance each other, stopping the stellar spin-up.   We hereinafter investigate the above physical picture within the framework of a Newtonian model describing compressible, non-magnetized, and self-gravitating NSs. In particular, we calculate the rotational frequency need to break the stellar crust of an accreting pulsar and we estimate the upper limit for the ellipticity due to this event. Depending on the equation of state (EoS) and on the mass of the star, we calculated that the starquake-induced ellipticity ranges from $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-5}$. The corresponding equilibrium frequency that we find is in good agreement with observations and, for all the scenarios, it is below the observational limit frequency of $716.36$ Hz. Finally, we also discuss possible observational constraints on the ellipticity upper limit of accreting pulsars. ",astrophysics

There are two key questions about thin Si today: (a) how much can we still benefit economically from thinning wafers? (b) what are the technological challenges to transition to thin wafers? In this work, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive techno-economic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, similarly high efficiencies are achievable for 50-um wafers as for 160-um ones. We then quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than 5% from the value of 160-um wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an advanced thin-wafer device concept with 50-um wafers could reduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is needed to facilitate more rapid PV growth. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers. ",physics
"  In this paper a robust algorithm for DOA estimation of coherent sources in presence of antenna array imperfections is presented. We exploit the current advances of deep learning to overcome two of the most common problems facing the state of the art DOA algorithms (i.e. coherent sources and array imperfections). We propose a deep auto encoder (AE) that is able to correctly resolve coherent sources without the need of spatial smoothing, hence avoiding possible processing overhead and delays. Moreover, we assumed the presence of array imperfections in the received signal model such as mutual coupling, gain/ phase mismatches, and position errors. The deep AE is trained using the covariance matrix of the received signal, where it alleviates the effect of imperfections, and at the same time act as a filters for the coherent sources. The results show significant improvement compared to the methods used in the literature. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  The results of field work on drift ice during wave propagation are analyzed and presented. The field work was performed in the Barents Sea, and the main focus of the paper is on wave processes in the MIZ. A model of wave damping in broken ice is formulated and applied to interpret the field work results. It is confirmed that waves of higher frequencies are subjected to stronger damping when they propagate below the ice. This reduces the frequency of most energetic wave with increasing distance from the ice edge. Difference of wave spectra measured in two relatively close locations within the MIZ is discussed. The complicated geometry and dynamics of the MIZ in the North-West Barents Sea allow waves from the Atlantic Ocean and south regions of the Barents Sea to penetrate into different locations of the MIZ.

"  The magnetic field of ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) pulsars is the key parameter to understand the nature and accretion physics. However, the typical magnetic field values in these ULX pulsars are still under debate. We used six different torque models to study the magnetic fields of ULX pulsars, to see how derived magnetic fields change with different models, and to determine which models are more suitable for ULX pulsars. We took the currently available period, period derivative, and flux data of 7 confirmed ULX pulsars, M82 X-2, ULX NGC 7793 P13, ULX NGC 5907, NGC 300 ULX1, NGC 1313 X-2, M51 ULX-7, Swift J0243.6+6124, plus one potential ULX pulsars, SMC X-3. The magnetic fields of these ULX pulsars were constrained from two physical conditions: the spin-up process and near equilibrium. We checked possible dependence of the magnetic field estimations on the different torque models. The calculations suggest the accretion torque models by Ghosh & Lamb [1], Wang [2], Kluzniak & Rappaport [3] and Campbell [4] are more likely to support magnetar models for ULX pulsars, while Lovelace, Romanova & Bisnovatyi-Kogan [5]'s model generally predicts the magnetic field in normal neutron stars. Implications of our results combined with other independent methods are also discussed, which will help us to understand the nature and rotational behavior of these ULX pulsars. ",astrophysics
"  The reliability of using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) has been successfully demonstrated by recent studies in many speech applications. One of the most popular variants of these FCNs is the `U-Net', which is an encoder-decoder network with skip connections. In this study, we propose `SkipConvNet' where we replace each skip connection with multiple convolutional modules to provide decoder with intuitive feature maps rather than encoder's output to improve the learning capacity of the network. We also propose the use of optimal smoothing of power spectral density (PSD) as a pre-processing step, which helps to further enhance the efficiency of the network. To evaluate our proposed system, we use the REVERB challenge corpus to assess the performance of various enhancement approaches under the same conditions. We focus solely on monitoring improvements in speech quality and their contribution to improving the efficiency of back-end speech systems, such as speech recognition and speaker verification, trained on only clean speech. Experimental findings show that the proposed system consistently outperforms other approaches. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Internet platforms' traffic defines important characteristics of platforms, such as price of services, advertisements, speed of operations. The traffic is usually estimated with the help of the traditional time series models (ARIMA, Holt-Winters, etc.), which are successful in short term extrapolations of sufficiently denoised signals. We propose a dynamical system approach for the modeling of the underlying process. The method allows to discuss the global qualitative properties of the dynamics' phase portrait and long term tendencies. The proposed models are nonchaotic, the long term prediction is reliable, and it explains the fundamental properties and trend of various types of digital platforms. Because of these properties, we call the flow of these models the {\it trending flow}. Utilizing the new approach, we construct the two-sided platform models for the volume of users, that can be applied to Amazon.com, Homes.mil or Wikipedia.org. We consider a generalization of the two-sided platforms' models to multi-sided platforms. If the equations' are cooperative, the flow is trending, and it helps to understand the properties of the platforms and reliably predicts the long term behavior. We show how to reconstruct the governing differential equations from time series data. The external effects are modeled as system's parameters (initial conditions). ",physics
"  We study the moduli space of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with $SU(N)$ gauge group and $F<N$ massless flavors. In the case of an $SU(2)$ theory with a single massless flavor, we explicitly calculate the quantum constraint $YM=1$ and generalize the calculation to models with arbitrary $N$ and $F=N-1$ flavors. In theories with $F<N-1$ flavors, we find that analogous constraints exist in locally defined coordinate charts of the moduli space. The existence of such constraints allows us to show that the Coulomb branch superpotential generated by single monopole effects is equivalent to the superpotential generated by multi-monopole contributions on the mixed Higgs-Coulomb branch. As a check for our result, we implement the local constraints as Lagrange multiplier terms in the superpotential and verify that deformations of a theory by a large holomorphic mass term for the matter fields results in a flow of the superpotential from the $F$-flavor model to the superpotential of an $(F-1)$-flavor model.

"  To reproduce the orbits and masses of the terrestrial planets (analogs) of the solar system, most studies scrutinize simulations for success as a batch. However, there is insufficient discussion in the literature on the likelihood of forming planet analogs simultaneously in the same system (analog system). To address this issue, we performed 540 N-body simulations of protoplanetary disks representative of typical models in the literature. We identified a total of 194 analog systems containing at least three analogs, but only 17 systems simultaneously contained analogs of the four terrestrial planets. From an analysis of our analog systems, we found that, compared to the real planets, truncated disks based on typical outcomes of the Grand Tack model produced analogs of Mercury and Mars that were too dynamically cold and located too close to the Venus and Earth analogs. Additionally, all the Mercury analogs were too massive, while most of the Mars analogs were more massive than Mars. Furthermore, the timing of the Moon-forming impact was too early in these systems, and the amount of additional mass accreted after the event was too great. Therefore, such truncated disks cannot explain the formation of the terrestrial planets. Our results suggest that forming the four terrestrial planets requires disks with the following properties: 1) Mass concentrated in narrow core regions between ~0.7-0.9 and ~1.0-1.2 au; 2) an inner region component starting at ~0.3-0.4 au; 3) a less massive component beginning at ~1.0-1.2 au; 4) embryos rather than planetesimals carrying most of the disk mass; and 5) Jupiter and Saturn placed on eccentric orbits.

"  Utilizing the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we present CS line maps in five rotational lines ($J_{\rm u}=7, 5, 4, 3, 2$) toward the circumnuclear disk (CND) and streamers of the Galactic Center. Our primary goal is to resolve the compact structures within the CND and the streamers, in order to understand the stability conditions of molecular cores in the vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sgr A*. Our data provide the first homogeneous high-resolution ($1.3'' = 0.05$ pc) observations aiming at resolving density and temperature structures. The CS clouds have sizes of $0.05-0.2$ pc with a broad range of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm FWHM}=5-40$ km s$^{-1}$). The CS clouds are a mixture of warm ($T_{\rm k}\ge 50-500$ K, n$_{\rm H_2}$=$10^{3-5}$ cm$^{-3}$) and cold gas ($T_{\rm k}\le 50$ K, n$_{\rm H_2}$=$10^{6-8}$ cm$^{-3}$). A stability analysis based on the unmagnetized virial theorem including tidal force shows that $84^{+16}_{-37}$ % of the total gas mass is tidally stable, which accounts for the majority of gas mass. Turbulence dominates the internal energy and thereby sets the threshold densities $10-100$ times higher than the tidal limit at distance $\ge 1.5$ pc to Sgr A*, and therefore, inhibits the clouds from collapsing to form stars near the SMBH. However, within the central $1.5$ pc, the tidal force overrides turbulence and the threshold densities for a gravitational collapse quickly grow to $\ge 10^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. ",astrophysics
"  In any type II superstring background, the supergravity vertex operators in the pure spinor formalism are described by a gauge superfield. In this paper, we obtain for the first time an explicit expression for this superfield in an $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background. Previously, the vertex operators were only known close to the boundary of $AdS_5$ or in the minus eight picture. Our strategy for the computation was to apply eight picture raising operators in the minus eight picture vertices. In the process, a huge number of terms are generated and we have developed numerical techniques to perform intermediary simplifications. Alternatively, the same numerical techniques can be used to compute the vertices directly in the zero picture by constructing a basis of invariants and fitting for the coefficients. One motivation for constructing the vertex operators is the computation of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ string amplitudes. ",high energy physics theory

If these surfaces have non-positive Euler characteristic (or in the case of 2-spheres, if the initial 2-spheres are large enough) and also if the initial spatial slice is expanding everywhere, then we prove that asymptotically the spacetime becomes physically indistinguishable from de Sitter space on arbitrarily large regions of spacetime. This holds true notwithstanding the presence of initial arbitrarily-large density fluctuations. ",high energy physics theory
"  Exascale computing holds great opportunities for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, to take full advantage of the new possibilities, we must learn how to focus computational power on the discovery of complex molecular mechanisms, and how to extract them from enormous amounts of data. Both aspects still rely heavily on human experts, which becomes a serious bottleneck when a large number of parallel simulations have to be orchestrated to take full advantage of the available computing power. Here, we use artificial intelligence (AI) both to guide the sampling and to extract the relevant mechanistic information. We combine advanced sampling schemes with statistical inference, artificial neural networks, and deep learning to discover molecular mechanisms from MD simulations. Our framework adaptively and autonomously initializes simulations and learns the sampled mechanism, and is thus suitable for massively parallel computing architectures. We propose practical solutions to make the neural networks interpretable, as illustrated in applications to molecular systems. ",physics
"  We explore here an scenario for massive black hole formation driven by stellar collisions in galactic nuclei, proposing a new formation regime of global instability in nuclear stellar clusters triggered by runaway stellar collisions. Using order of magnitude estimations, we show that observed nuclear stellar clusters avoid the regime where stellar collisions are dynamically relevant over the whole system, while resolved detections of massive black holes are well into such collision-dominated regime. We interpret this result in terms of massive black holes and nuclear stellar clusters being different evolutionary paths of a common formation mechanism, unified under the standard terminology of being both central massive objects. We propose a formation scenario where central massive objects more massive than $\rm \sim 10^8 \, Msun$, which also have relaxation times longer that their collision times, will be too dense (in virial equilibrium) to be globally stable against stellar collisions and most of its mass will collapse towards the formation of a massive black hole. Contrarily, this will only be the case at the core of less dense central massive objects leading to the formation of black holes with much lower black hole efficiencies $\rm \epsilon_{BH} = \frac{M_{BH}}{M_{CMO}}$, with these efficiencies $\rm \epsilon_{BH}$ drastically growing for central massive objects more massive than $\rm \sim 10^7 \, Msun$, approaching unity around $\rm M_{CMO} \sim 10^8 \, Msun$. We show that the proposed scenario successfully explains the relative trends observed in the masses, efficiencies, and scaling relations between massive black holes and nuclear stellar clusters.

"  Models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibia that for computational convenience assume the existence of a system of nested magnetic flux surfaces tend to exhibit singular current sheets. These sheets are located on resonant flux surfaces that are associated with rational values of the rotational transform. We study the possibility of eliminating these singularities by suitable modifications of the plasma boundary, which we prescribe in a fixed boundary setting. We find that relatively straightforward iterative procedures can be used to eliminate weak current sheets that are generated at resonant flux surfaces by the nonlinear interactions of resonating wall harmonics. These types of procedures may prove useful in the design of fusion devices with configurations that enjoy improved stability and transport properties. ",physics
"  State estimation (SE) of distribution networks heavily relies on pseudo measurements that introduce significant errors, since real-time measurements are insufficient. Interval SE models are regularly used, where true values of system states are supposed to be within the estimated ranges. However, conventional interval SE algorithms cannot consider the correlations of same interval variables in different terms of constraints, which results in overly conservative estimation results. In this paper, we propose a Linear Programming (LP) Contractor algorithm that uses a relative distance measure (RDM) interval operation to solve this problem. In the proposed model, measurement errors are assumed to be bounded into given sets, thus converting the state variables to RDM variables. In this case, the SE model is a non-convex model, and the solution credibility cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each nonlinear measurement equation in the model is transformed into dual inequality linear equations using the mean value theorem. The SE model is finally reformulated as a linear programming contractor that iteratively narrows the upper and lower bounds of the system state variables. Numerical tests on IEEE three-phase distribution networks show that the proposed method outperforms the conventional interval-constrained propagation, modified Krawczyk-operator and optimization based interval SE methods.

"  Starting with the correspondence between positive definite kernels on the one hand and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) on the other, we turn to a detailed analysis of associated measures and Gaussian processes. Point of departure: Every positive definite kernel is also the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process.   Given a fixed sigma-finite measure $\mu$, we consider positive definite kernels defined on the subset of the sigma algebra having finite $\mu$ measure. We show that then the corresponding Hilbert factorizations consist of signed measures, finitely additive, but not automatically sigma-additive. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for when the measures in the RKHS, and the Hilbert factorizations, are sigma-additive. Our emphasis is the case when $\mu$ is assumed non-atomic. By contrast, when $\mu$ is known to be atomic, our setting is shown to generalize that of Shannon-interpolation. Our RKHS-approach further leads to new insight into the associated Gaussian processes, their It\^{o} calculus and diffusion. Examples include fractional Brownian motion, and time-change processes.

"  Self-interacting dark matter may have striking astrophysical signatures, such as observable offsets between galaxies and dark matter in merging galaxy clusters. Numerical N-body simulations used to predict such observables typically treat the galaxies as collisionless test particles, a questionable assumption given that each galaxy is embedded in its own dark matter halo. To enable a more accurate treatment we develop an effective description of small dark matter haloes taking into account the two major effects due to dark matter self-scatterings: deceleration and evaporation. We point out that self-scatterings can have a sizeable impact on the trajectories of galaxies, diminishing the separation between galaxies and dark matter in merging clusters. This effect depends sensitively on the underlying particle physics, in particular the angular dependence of the self-scattering cross section, and cannot be predicted from the momentum transfer cross section alone.

We show that it has finite limits and that the canonical functor $\mathcal{C}\to \mathrm{Spec}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S})$ preserves finite limits. When $\mathcal{C}$ is a normal category, assuming for simplicity that $\mathcal{S}$ is the class of all monomorphisms in $\mathcal{C}$, we show that pullback stable $\mathcal{S}$-essential monomorphisms are the same as what we call subobject-essential monomorphisms.

We extend these results to two-loop order and to a one-parameter family of deformations. We further study the spectral rigidity for these models and show that it is also well described by random matrix theory. Finally we demonstrate that the finite-N eigenvectors possess properties of chaotic states. ",high energy physics theory
"  The field of attosecond science was first enabled by nonlinear compression of intense laser pulses to a duration below two optical cycles. Twenty years later, creating such short pulses still requires state-of-the-art few-cycle laser amplifiers to most efficiently exploit 'instantaneous' optical nonlinearities in noble gases for spectral broadening and parametric frequency conversion. Here, we show that nonlinear compression can in fact be much more efficient when driven in molecular gases by pulses substantially longer than a few cycles, due to enhanced optical nonlinearity associated with rotational alignment. We use 80-cycle pulses from an industrial-grade laser amplifier to simultaneously drive molecular alignment and supercontinuum generation in a gas-filled capillary, producing more than two octaves of coherent bandwidth and achieving >45-fold compression to a duration of 1.7 cycles. As the enhanced nonlinearity is linked to rotational motion, the dynamics can be exploited for long-wavelength frequency conversion and compressing picosecond lasers. ",physics
"  Black hole - neutron star (BH-NS) mergers are a major target for ground-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories. A merger can also produce an electromagnetic counterpart (a kilonova) if it ejects neutron-rich matter that assembles into heavy elements through r-process nucleosynthesis. We study the kilonova signatures of the unbound dynamical ejecta of a BH-NS merger. We take as our initial state the results from a numerical relativity simulation, and then use a general relativistic hydrodynamics code to study the evolution of the ejecta with parameterized r-process heating models. The unbound dynamical ejecta is initially a flattened, directed tidal tail largely confined to a plane. Heating from the r-process inflates the ejecta into a more spherical shape and smooths its small-scale structure, though the ejecta retains its bulk directed motion. We calculate the electromagnetic signatures using a 3D radiative transfer code and a parameterized opacity model for lanthanide-rich matter. The light curve varies with viewing angle due to two effects: asphericity results in brighter emission for orientations with larger projected areas, while Doppler boosting results in brighter emission for viewing angles more aligned with the direction of bulk motion. For typical r-process heating rates, the peak bolometric luminosity varies by a factor of $\sim 3$ with orientation while the peak in the optical bands varies by $\sim 3$ magnitudes. The spectrum is blue-shifted at viewing angles along the bulk motion, which increases the $V$-band peak magnitude to $\sim -14$ despite the lanthanide-rich composition. ",astrophysics

Motivated from holographic results, the difference between odd and von Neumann entropy is also studied. In particular, we show that large amounts of quantum correlations ensure the odd entropy to be larger than von Neumann entropy, which is qualitatively consistent with the holographic CFT. In general cases, we also find that this difference is not even a monotonic function with respect to size of (and distance between) subsystems. ",high energy physics theory
"  We argue that the `island conjecture' and the replica wormhole derivation of the Page curve break monogamy of entanglement through allowing black hole interior states to be non-classically correlated while also pairwise entangled with radiation states.

"  The core-cusp problem is one of the controversial issues in the standard paradigm of $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) theory. However, under the assumption of conventional spherical symmetry, the strong degeneracy among model parameters makes it unclear whether dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies indeed have cored dark matter density profiles at the centers. In this work, we revisit this problem using non-spherical mass models, which have the advantage of being able to alleviate the degeneracy. Applying our mass models to the currently available kinematic data of the eight classical dSphs, we find that within finite uncertainties, most of these dSphs favor cusped central profiles rather than cored ones. In particular, Draco has a cusped dark matter halo with high probability even considering a prior bias. We also find the diversity of the inner slopes in their dark matter halos. To clarify the origin of this diversity, we investigate the relation between the inner dark matter density slope and stellar-to-halo mass ratio for the sample dSphs and find this relation is generally in agreement with the predictions from recent $\Lambda$CDM and hydrodynamical simulations. We also find that the simulated subhalos have anti-correlation between the dark matter density at 150 pc and pericenter distance, which is consistent with the observed one. We estimate their astrophysical factors for dark matter indirect searches and circular velocity profiles, associated with huge uncertainties. To more precisely estimate their dark matter profiles, wide-field spectroscopic surveys for the dSphs are essential. ",astrophysics
"  A well-known problem of the $\Lambda$CDM model is the tension between the relatively high level of clustering, as quantified by the parameter $\sigma_8$, found in cosmic microwave background experiments and the smaller one obtained from large-scale observations in the late Universe. In this paper we show that coupled quintessence, i.e. a single dark energy scalar field conformally coupled to dark matter through a constant coupling, can solve this problem if the background is taken to be identical to the $\Lambda$CDM one. We show that two competing effects arise. On one hand, the additional scalar force is attractive, and is therefore expected to increase the clustering. On the other, in order to obtain the same background as $\Lambda$CDM, coupled quintessence must have a smaller amount of dark matter near the present epoch. We show that the second effect is dominating today and leads to an overall slower growth. Comparing to redshift distortion data, we find that coupled quintessence with $\Lambda$CDM background solves the tension between early and late clustering. We find for the coupling $\beta$ and for $\sigma_8$ the best fit values $|\beta| = 0.079^{+ 0.059}_{- 0.067}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.818^{+0.115}_{-0.088}$. These values also fit the lensing data from the KiDS-450 survey. We also estimate that the future missions SKA and Euclid will constrain $\beta$ with an error of $\pm\, 1.5\times10^{-3}$ and for $\sigma_8$ of $\pm \,1.8\times10^{-3}$ at $1\sigma$ level.

"  In today's global economy, supply chain (SC) entities have become increasingly interconnected with demand and supply relationships due to the need for strategic outsourcing. Such interdependence among firms not only increases efficiency but also creates more vulnerabilities in the system. Natural and human-made disasters such as floods and transport accidents may halt operations and lead to economic losses. Due to the interdependence among firms, the adverse effects of any disruption can be amplified and spread throughout the systems. This paper aims at studying the robustness of SC networks against cascading failures. Considering the upper and lower bound load constraints, i.e., inventory and cost, we examine the fraction of failed entities under load decrease and load fluctuation scenarios. The simulation results obtained from synthetic networks and a European supply chain network [1] both confirm that the recovery strategies of surplus inventory and backup suppliers often adopted in actual SCs can enhance the system robustness, compared with the system without the recovery process. In addition, the system is relatively robust against load fluctuations but is more fragile to demand shocks. For the underload-driven model without the recovery process, we found an occurrence of a discontinuous phase transition. Differently from other systems studied under overload cascading failures, this system is more robust for power-law distributions than uniform distributions of the lower bound parameter for the studied scenarios.

"  Given fields $k \subseteq L$, our results concern one parameter $L$-parametric polynomials over $k$, and their relation to generic polynomials. The former are polynomials $P(T,Y) \in k[T][Y]$ of group $G$ which parametrize all Galois extensions of $L$ of group $G$ via specialization of $T$ in $L$, and the latter are those which are $L$-parametric for every field $L \supseteq k$.

The goal of this work is therefore to improve the robustness and quality of 3D radial CMRA by incorporating both 3D motion information and nonrigid intra-acquisition correction of the data into a framework called focused navigation (fNAV). Methods: We applied fNAV to 500 data sets from a numerical simulation, 22 healthy volunteers, and 549 cardiac patients. We compared fNAV to RSN and respiratory resolved XD-GRASP reconstructions of the same data and recorded reconstruction times. Motion accuracy was measured as the correlation between fNAV and ground truth for simulations, and fNAV and image registration for in vivo data. Vessel sharpness was measured using Soap-Bubble. Finally, image quality analysis was performed by a blinded expert reviewer who chose the best image for each data set. Results The reconstruction time for fNAV images was significantly higher than RSN (6.1 +/- 2.1 minutes vs 1.4 +/- 0.3, minutes, p<0.025) but significantly lower than XD-GRASP (25.6 +/- 7.1, minutes, p<0.025). There is high correlation between the fNAV, and reference displacement estimates across all data sets (0.73 +/- 0.29). For all data, fNAV lead to significantly sharper vessels than all other reconstructions (p < 0.01). Finally, a blinded reviewer chose fNAV as the best image in 239 out of 571 cases (p = 10-5). Conclusion: fNAV is a promising technique for improving free-breathing 3D radial whole-heart CMRA. This novel approach to respiratory self-navigation can derive 3D nonrigid motion estimations from an acquired 1D signal yielding statistically significant improvement in image sharpness relative to 1D translational correction as well as XD-GRASP reconstructions.

"  The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a conjugated polymer as the active material is the elementary unit of organic bioelectronic devices. Increased functionalities, such as low power consumption, can be achieved by building complementary circuits featuring two or more OECTs. Complementary circuits commonly combine both p- and n-type transistors to reduce power draw. While p-type OECTs are readily available, n-type OECTs are less common mainly due to poor stability of the n-type active channel material in aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, an OECT based complementary circuit requires well matched transport properties in the p- and n-type materials. Here, a complementary circuit is made using a pair of OECTs having polyaniline (PANI) as the channel material in both transistors. PANI is chosen due to its unique behaviour exhibiting a peak in current versus gate voltage when used as an active channel in an OECT. The PANI based circuit is shown to have excellent performance with gain of ~ 7 and could be transferred on a flexible biocompatible chitosan substrate with demonstrated operation in aqueous electrolyte. This study extends the capabilities of conjugated polymer based OECTs. ",physics
"  This book provides a completely new approach to understanding the universe. The main idea is that the principal objects in the universe form a spectrum unified by the presence of a massive or hypermassive black hole. These objects are variously called quasars, active galaxies and spiral galaxies. The key to understanding their dynamics is angular momentum and the key tool, and main innovative idea of this work, is a proper formulation of ""Mach's principle"" using Sciama's ideas. In essence, what is provided here is a totally new paradigm for the universe. In this paradigm, there is no big bang, and the universe is many orders of magnitude older than current estimates for its age. Indeed there is no natural limit for its age. ",astrophysics

"  In this article, we introduce two families of novel fractional $\theta$-methods by constructing some new generating functions to discretize the Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus operator $\mathit{I}^{\alpha}$ with a second order convergence rate. A new fractional BT-$\theta$ method connects the fractional BDF2 (when $\theta=0$) with fractional trapezoidal rule (when $\theta=1/2$), and another novel fractional BN-$\theta$ method joins the fractional BDF2 (when $\theta=0$) with the second order fractional Newton-Gregory formula (when $\theta=1/2$). To deal with the initial singularity, correction terms are added to achieve an optimal convergence order. In addition, stability regions of different $\theta$-methods when applied to the Abel equations of the second kind are depicted, which demonstrate the fact that the fractional $\theta$-methods are A($\vartheta$)-stable. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to verify our theoretical result on the convergence analysis. ",mathematics

This corrects a previous work\cite{owr}, and introduces a new technique that we call ""coning"" to effectively induce high weight stabilizers in an LDPC code. As one application, any LDPC code (with arbitrary $O(1)$ stabilizer weights) may be turned into a code where all stabilizers have weight at most $5$ at the cost of at most a constant factor increase in number of physical qubits and constant factor reduction in distance. Also, by applying this technique to a quantum code whose $X$-stabilizers are derived from a classical log-weight random code and whose $Z$-stabilizers have linear weight, we construct an LDPC quantum code with distance $\tilde \Omega(N^{2/3})$ and $\tilde\Omega(N^{2/3})$ logical qubits.

"  Multi-wavelength analyses of spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) provide useful information on the physical processes in the accretion disk and jets of black holes. This, however, is limited to bright sources and may not represent the population as a whole. Another approach is through the investigation of the cosmological evolution of the luminosity function (LF) that shows varied evolution (luminosity and density) at different wavelengths. These differences and the correlations between luminosities can shed light on the Jet-accretion disk connection. Most such studies use forward fitting parametric methods that involve several functions and many parameters. We use non-parametric, non-binning methods developed by Efron and Petrosian, and Lynden-Bell, for obtaining unbiased description of the evolution of the LF, from data truncated by observational selection effects. We present analysis of the evolution of gamma-ray LF of blazars with main focus on flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). This requires analysis of both gamma-ray and optical data, essential for redshift measurements, and a description of the joint LF. We use a new approach which divides the sample into two sub-samples, each with its own flux limit. We use the Fermi-LAT and GAIA observations, and present results on the gamma-ray LF and its evolution, and determine the intrinsic correlation between the gamma-ray and optical luminosities corrected for the well known false correlation induced by their similar redshift dependence and evolution of the two luminosities. We also present a direct estimation of the contribution of blazars to the spectrum of the extragalactic gamma-ray background. ",astrophysics
"  We show that Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) predict distinct galactic acceleration curve geometries in $g2$-space - the space of total observed centripetal accelerations $g_{\rm tot}$ vs the inferred Newtonian acceleration from baryonic matter $g_{\rm N}$ - and corresponding rotation speed curves: MOND modified gravity predicts cored geometries for isolated galaxies while MOND modified inertia yields neutral geometries, ie. neither cuspy or cored, based on a cusp-core classification of galaxy rotation curve geometry in $g2$-space - rather than on inferred DM density profiles. The classification can be applied both to DM and modified gravity models as well as data and implies a {\it cusp-core} challenge for MOND from observations, for example of cuspy galaxies, which is different from the so-called cusp-core problem of dark matter (DM). We illustrate this challenge by a number of cuspy and also cored galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve database, which deviate significantly from the MOND modified gravity and MOND modified inertia predictions.

"  The work extends the computational model EULAG-MHD to include Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD)---important to explore physical systems undergoing fast magnetic reconnection at the order of the ion inertial length scale. Examples include solar transients along with reconnections in magnetosphere, magnetotail and   laboratory plasmas. The paper documents the results of two distinct sets of implicit large-eddy simulations in the presence and absence of the Hall forcing term, initiated with an unidirectional sinusoidal magnetic field. The HMHD simulation while benchmarking the code also emphasizes the complexity of three dimensional (3D) evolution over its two dimensional (2D) counterpart. The magnetic reconnections onset significantly earlier in HMHD. Importantly, the magnetic field generated by the Hall term breaks any inherent symmetry, ultimately making the evolution 3D. The resulting 3D reconnections develop magnetic flux ropes and magnetic flux tubes. Projected on the reconnection plane, the ropes and tubes appear as magnetic islands, which later break into secondary islands, and finally coalesce to generate an X-type neutral point. These findings are in agreement with the theory and contemporary simulations of HMHD, and thus verify our extension of the EULAG-MHD model. The second set explores the influence of the Hall forcing on generation and ascend of a magnetic flux rope from sheared magnetic arcades---a novel scenario instructive in understanding the coronal transients. The rope evolves through intermediate complex structures, ultimately breaking locally because of reconnections. Interestingly, the breakage occurs earlier in the presence of the Hall term, signifying faster dynamics leading to magnetic topology favorable for reconnections. ",astrophysics
"  Consider a non-doubling manifold with ends $M = \mathfrak{R}^{n}\sharp\, {\mathbb R}^{m}$ where $\mathfrak{R}^n=\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{S}^{m-n}$ for $m> n \ge 3$. We say that an operator $L$ has a generalised Poisson kernel if $\sqrt{ L}$ generates a semigroup $e^{-t\sqrt{L}}$ whose kernel $p_t(x,y)$ has an upper bound similar to the kernel of $e^{-t\sqrt{\Delta}}$ where $\Delta$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M$.

On our ${\rm BMO}_L(M)$ spaces, we show that the John--Nirenberg inequality holds and we show an interpolation theorem for a holomorphic family of operators which interpolates between $L^q(M)$ and ${\rm BMO}_L(M)$. As an application, we show that the holomorphic functional calculus $m(\sqrt{L})$ is bounded from $L^{\infty}(M)$ into ${\rm BMO}_L(M)$, and bounded on $L^p(M)$ for $1 < p < \infty$. ",mathematics
"  Many homotopy-coherent algebraic structures can be described by Segal-type limit conditions determined by an ""algebraic pattern"", bywhich we mean an $\infty$-category equipped with a factorization system and a collection of ""elementary"" objects. Examples of structures that occur as such ""Segal $\mathcal{O}$-spaces"" for an algebraic pattern $\mathcal{O}$ include $\infty$-categories, $(\infty,n)$-categories, $\infty$-operads, $\infty$-properads, and algebras for an $\infty$-operad in spaces.   In the first part of this paper we set up a general frameworkn for algebraic patterns and their Segal objects, including conditions under which the latter are preserved by left and right Kan extensions. In particular, we obtain necessary and sufficent conditions on a pattern $\mathcal{O}$ for free Segal $\mathcal{O}$-spaces to be described by an explicit colimit formula, in which case we say that $\mathcal{O}$ is ""extendable"".   In the second part of the paper we explore the relationship between extendable algebraic patterns and polynomial monads, by which we mean cartesian monads on presheaf $\infty$-categories that are accessible and preserve weakly contractible limits. We first show that the free Segal $\mathcal{O}$-space monad for an extendable pattern $\mathcal{O}$ is always polynomial. Next, we prove an $\infty$-categorical version of Weber's Nerve Theorem for polynomial monads, and use this to define a canonical extendable pattern from any polynomial monad, whose Segal spaces are equivalent to the algebras of the monad. These constructions yield functors between polynomial monads and extendable algebraic patterns, and we show that these exhibit full subcategories of ""saturated"" algebraic patterns and ""complete"" polynomial monads as localizations, and moreover restrict to an equivalence between the $\infty$-categories of saturated patterns and complete polynomial monads.

"  In the Second Order Theories (SOT) of real relativistic fluids, the non-ideal properties of the flows are described by a new set of dynamical tensor variables. In this work we explore the non-linear dynamics of those variables in a conformal fluid. Among all possible SOTs, we choose to work with the Divergence Type Theories (DTT) formalism, which ensures that the second law of thermodynamics is fulfilled non-perturbatively. The tensor modes include two divergence-free modes which have no analog in theories based on covariant generalizations of the Navier-Stokes equation, and that are particularly relevant because they couple linearly to a gravitational field. To study the dynamics of this irreducible tensor sector, we observe that in causal theories such as DTTs, thermal fluctuations induce a stochastic stirring force, which excites the tensor modes while preserving energy momentum conservation. From fluctuation-dissipation considerations it follows that the random force is Gaussian with a white spectrum. The irreducible tensor modes in turn excite vector modes, which back-react on the tensor sector, thus producing a consistent non-linear, second order description of the divergence-free tensor dynamics. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose (MSR) formalism plus the Two-Particle Irreducible Effective Action (2PIEA) formalism, we obtain the one-loop corrected equations for the relevant two-point correlation functions of the model: the retarded propagator and the Hadamard function. The overall result of the self-consistent dynamics of the irreducible tensor modes at this order is a depletion of the spectrum in the UV sector, which suggests that tensor modes could sustain an inverse entropy cascade.

"  The band structure of photons in cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) is investigated in the shortwave approximation. The bound states or narrow resonances of photons in the CLC are formed by the extraordinary waves. The explicit expressions for the spectrum bands and the dispersion laws of photons in these bands are obtained. It is shown that these states describe photons propagating almost perpendicular to the CLC axis. The density of photon states acquires a sharp peak due to the presence of bound states. Near this peak, in the particular case of plasma permittivity, the photons posses a linear or quadratic dispersion relations in the directions perpendicular to the CLC axis depending on the sign of the anisotropy of the CLC permittivity tensor. The resonances in the CLC plate are also described. ",physics
"  Extremely low density planets ('super-puffs') are a small but intriguing subset of the transiting planet population. With masses in the super-Earth range ($1-10$ M$_{\oplus}$) and radii akin to those of giant planets ($>4$ R$_{\oplus}$), their large envelopes may have been accreted beyond the water snow line and many appear to be susceptible to catastrophic mass loss. Both the presence of water and the importance of mass loss can be explored using transmission spectroscopy. Here, we present new HST WFC3 spectroscopy and updated Kepler transit depth measurements for the super-puff Kepler-79d. We do not detect any molecular absorption features in the $1.1-1.7$ $\mu$m WFC3 bandpass and the combination of Kepler and WFC3 data are consistent with a flat line model, indicating the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. We compare the shape of Kepler-79d's transmission spectrum to predictions from a microphysical haze model that incorporates an outward particle flux due to ongoing mass loss. We find that photochemical hazes offer an attractive explanation for the observed properties of super-puffs like Kepler-79d, as they simultaneously render the near-infrared spectrum featureless and reduce the inferred envelope mass loss rate by moving the measured radius (optical depth unity surface during transit) to lower pressures. We revisit the broader question of mass loss rates for super-puffs and find that the age estimates and mass loss rates for the majority of super-puffs can be reconciled if hazes move the photosphere from the typically assumed pressure of $\sim 10$ mbar to $\sim 10 \; \mu$bar.

"  Spectral clustering is one of the most popular algorithms for community detection in network analysis. Based on this rationale, in this paper we give the convergence rate of eigenvectors for the adjacency matrix in the $l_\infty$ norm, under the stochastic block model (BM) and degree corrected stochastic block model (DCBM), adding some mild and rational conditions. We also extend this result to a more general model, presented based on the DCBM such that the value of random variables in the adjacency matrix is not 0 or 1, but an arbitrary real number. During the process of proving the above conclusion, we obtain the relationship of the eigenvalues in the adjacency matrix and the corresponding `population' matrix, which vary in dimension from the community-wise edge probability matrix. Using that result, we can give an estimate of the number of the communities in a known set of network data. Meanwhile we proved the consistency of the estimator. Furthermore, according to the derivation of proof for the convergence of eigenvectors, we propose a new approach to community detection -- Spectral Clustering based on Difference of Ratios of Eigenvectors (SCDRE). Our simulation experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in community detection. ",mathematics
"  Spectral computed tomography (CT) has attracted much attention in radiation dose reduction, metal artifacts removal, tissue quantification and material discrimination. The x-ray energy spectrum is divided into several bins, each energy-bin-specific projection has a low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) than the current-integrating counterpart, which makes image reconstruction a unique challenge. Traditional wisdom is to use prior knowledge based iterative methods. However, this kind of methods demands a great computational cost. Inspired by deep learning, here we first develop a deep learning based reconstruction method; i.e., U-net with L_p^p-norm, Total variation, Residual learning, and Anisotropic adaption (ULTRA). Specifically, we emphasize the Various Multi-scale Feature Fusion and Multichannel Filtering Enhancement with a denser connection encoding architecture for residual learning and feature fusion. To address the image deblurring problem associated with the $L_2^2$-loss, we propose a general $L_p^p$-loss, $p>0$ Furthermore, the images from different energy bins share similar structures of the same object, the regularization characterizing correlations of different energy bins is incorporated into the $L_p^p$-loss function, which helps unify the deep learning based methods with traditional compressed sensing based methods. Finally, the anisotropically weighted total variation is employed to characterize the sparsity in the spatial-spectral domain to regularize the proposed network. In particular, we validate our ULTRA networks on three large-scale spectral CT datasets, and obtain excellent results relative to the competing algorithms. In conclusion, our quantitative and qualitative results in numerical simulation and preclinical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is accurate, efficient and robust for high-quality spectral CT image reconstruction.

"  In the Swampland philosophy of constraining EFTs from black hole mechanics we study charged black hole evaporation in de Sitter space. We establish how the black hole mass and charge change over time due to both Hawking radiation and Schwinger pair production as a function of the masses and charges of the elementary particles in the theory. We find a lower bound on the mass of charged particles by demanding that large charged black holes evaporate back to empty de Sitter space, in accordance with the thermal picture of the de Sitter static patch. This bound is satisfied by the charged spectrum of the Standard Model. We discuss phenomenological implications for the cosmological hierarchy problem and inflation. Enforcing the thermal picture also leads to a heuristic remnant argument for the Weak Gravity Conjecture in de Sitter space, where the usual kinematic arguments do not work. We also comment on a possible relation between WGC and universal bounds on equilibration times. All in all, charged black holes in de Sitter should make haste to evaporate, but they should not rush it. ",high energy physics theory

We propose a theoretical model for this phenomenon and, with the aid of DFT calculations, apply it to the case of a dihydropyrene-type photochromic molecular donor. By considering the wavepacket dynamics and the photoisomerization yield, we show that the two processes involved, electron transfer and photoisomerization, are in general inseparable and need to be treated in a unified manner. We finish by discussing how the efficiency of photoisomerization-coupled electron transfer can be controlled experimentally. ",physics

"  Building upon the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism for spinning bodies developed for the Post-Newtonian regime, we generalize the EFT approach to Post-Minkowskian (PM) dynamics to include rotational degrees of freedom in a manifestly covariant framework. We introduce a systematic procedure to compute the total change in momentum and spin in the gravitational scattering of compact objects. For the special case of spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum, we show how to construct the radial action for elliptic-like orbits using the Boundary-to-Bound correspondence. As a paradigmatic example, we solve the scattering problem to next-to-leading PM order with linear and bilinear spin effects and arbitrary initial conditions, incorporating for the first time finite-size corrections. We obtain the aligned-spin radial action from the resulting scattering data, and derive the periastron advance and binding energy for circular orbits. We also provide the (square of the) center-of-mass momentum to ${\cal O}(G^2)$, which may be used to reconstruct a Hamiltonian. Our results are in perfect agreement with the existent literature, while at the same time extend the knowledge of the PM dynamics of compact binaries at quadratic order in spins.

"  Classical rotating closed string are folded strings. At the folding points the scalar curvature associated with the induced metric diverges. As a consequence one cannot properly quantize the fluctuations around the classical solution since there is no complete set of normalizable eigenmodes. Furthermore in the non-critical effective string action of Polchinski and Strominger, there is a divergence associated with the folds. We overcome this obstacle by putting a massive particle at each folding point which can be used as a regulator. Using this method we compute the spectrum of quantum fluctuations around the rotating string and the intercept of the leading Regge trajectory. The results we find are that the intercepts are $a=1$ and $a=2$ for the open and closed string respectively, independent of the target space dimension. We argue that in generic theories with an effective string description, one can expect corrections from finite masses associated with either the endpoints of an open string or the folding points on a closed string. We compute explicitly the corrections in the presence of these masses. ",high energy physics theory

Our proposal reduces to known results involving the entropy in settings where the thermodynamic volume and entropy are not independent, but has broader scope. Assuming a conjectured inequality is obeyed by the thermodynamic volume, we establish that the complexity of formation is bounded from below by the entropy for large black holes.

"  During coalescence of liquid drops contacting a solid, the liquid sweeps wetted and solid-projected areas. The extent of sweeping dictates the performance of devices such as self-cleaning surfaces, anti-frost coatings, water harvesters, and dropwise condensers. For these applications, weakly- and non-wetting solid substrates are preferred as they enhance drop dynamical behavior. Accordingly, our coalescence studies here are restricted to drops with contact angle 90{\deg} $\le \theta_{0} \le$ 180{\deg}. Binary sessile drop coalescence is the focus, with volume of fluid simulations employed as the primary tool. The simulations, which incorporate a Kistler dynamic contact angle model, are first validated against three different experimental substrate systems and then used to study the influence of solid wettability on sweeping by modifying $\theta_{0}$. With increasing $\theta_{0}$ up to 150{\deg}, wetted and projected swept areas both increase as drop center of mass heightens. For $\theta_{0} \ge$ 150{\deg}, coalescence-induced drop jumping occurs owing to the decreasing wettability of the substrate and a focusing of liquid momentum due to the symmetry-breaking solid. In this regime, projected swept area continues to increase with $\theta_0$ while wetted swept area reaches a maximum and then decreases. The sweeping results are interpreted using the mechanical energy balance from hydrodynamic theory and also compared to free drop coalescence. ",physics
"  The power graph P(G) of a group G is a graph with vertex set G, where two vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if one is the power of the other.

In particular, we determine prove that all such n are cube-free and are not multiples of 16. Moreover, we show that if two finite groups have isomorphic power graphs and one of them is nilpotent or has a normal Hall subgroup, the same is true with the other one. ",mathematics
"  Edge states protected by bulk topology of photonic crystals show robustness against short-range disorder, making robust information transfer possible. Here, topological photonic crystals under long-range deformations are investigated. Vertices of each regular hexagon in a honeycomb crystalline structure are shifted randomly to establish a deformed system. By increasing the degree of random deformations, a transition from an ordered system to an amorphous system are investigated, where the close of topological bandgap is clearly shown. We further present comprehensive investigations into excitation methods of the proposed deformed system. Due to the lack of strict periodicity, excitation of topological edge modes becomes difficult. Chiral and linearly polarized sources as two different methods are investigated respectively. It is found that chiral sources are sensitive and rely on the ordered lattice. Even a weak long-range deformation can bring fluctuations to transmission. We further designed and fabricated metal-dielectric-metal sandwich-like samples working in the microwave band. Using linearly polarized source, we detected the existence of topological transport in the deformed system. This work investigates excitation and robustness of bulk topology against long-range deformations and may open the way for exploiting topological properties of materials with a deformed lattice.

"  There are no direct spatially resolved observations of spots on stars other than the Sun and starspot properties are inferred indirectly through lightcurves and spectropolarimetric data. We present the first self-consistent 3D radiative MHD computations of starspots on G2V, K0V and M0V stars, which will help to better understand observations of activity, variability and magnetic fields in late-type main-sequence stars. We used the MURaM code, which has been extensively used to compute ""realistic"" sunspots, for our simulations. We aim to study how fundamental starspot properties such as intensity contrast, temperature and magnetic field strength vary with spectral type. We first simulated in 2D, multiple spots of each spectral type to find out appropriate initial conditions for our 3D runs. We find that with increasing stellar effective temperature, there is an increase in the temperature difference between the umbra of the spot and its surrounding photosphere, from 350K on the M0V star to 1400K on the G2V star. This trend in our simulated starspots is consistent with observations. The magnetic field strengths of all the starspot umbrae are in the 3-4.5 kG range. The G2V and K0V umbrae have comparable magnetic field strengths around 3.5 kG, while the M0V umbra has a relatively higher field strength around 4 kG. We discuss the physical reasons behind both these trends. All of the three starspots develop penumbral filament-like structures with Evershed flows. The average Evershed flow speed drops from 1.32 km s$^{-1}$ in the G2V penumbra to 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ in the M0V penumbra. ",astrophysics
"  Purpose: To develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent for fully-automated rapid head and neck (H&N) IMRT plan generation without time-consuming inverse planning.$$$$   Methods: This AI agent was trained using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network architecture. The generator, PyraNet, is a novel Deep Learning network that implements 28 classic ResNet blocks in pyramid-like concatenations. The discriminator is a customized 4-layer DenseNet. The AI agent first generates customized 2D projections at 9 template beam angles from 3D CT volume and structures of a patient. These projections are then stacked as 4D inputs of PyraNet, from which 9 radiation fluence maps are generated simultaneously. Finally, the predicted fluence maps are imported into a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) for plan integrity checks. The AI agent was built and tested upon 231 oropharyngeal plans from a TPS plan library. Only the primary plans in the sequential boost regime were studied. A customized Harr wavelet loss was adopted for fluence map comparison. Isodose distributions in test AI plans and TPS plans were qualitatively evaluated. Key dosimetric metrics were statistically compared.$$$$   Results: All test AI plans were successfully generated. Isodose gradients outside of PTV in AI plans were comparable with TPS plans. After PTV coverage normalization, $D_{mean}$ of parotids and oral cavity in AI plans and TPS plans were comparable without statistical significance. AI plans achieved comparable $D_{max}$ at 0.01cc of brainstem and cord+5mm without clinically relevant differences, but body $D_{max}$ was higher than the TPS plan results. The AI agent needs ~3s per case to predict fluence maps.$$$$   Conclusions: The developed AI agent can generate H&N IMRT plans with satisfying dosimetry quality. With rapid and fully automated implementation, it holds great potential for clinical applications. ",physics
"  The Dimits shift is the shift between the threshold of the drift-wave primary instability and the actual onset of turbulent transport in magnetized plasma. It is generally attributed to the suppression of turbulence by zonal flows, but developing a more detailed understanding calls for consideration of specific reduced models. The modified Terry--Horton system has been proposed by St-Onge [J. Plasma Phys. $\boldsymbol{\rm 83}$, 905830504 (2017)] as a minimal model capturing the Dimits shift. Here, we use this model to develop an analytic theory of the Dimits shift and a related theory of the tertiary instability of zonal flows. We show that tertiary modes are localized near extrema of the zonal velocity $U(x)$, where $x$ is the radial coordinate. By approximating $U(x)$ with a parabola, we derive the tertiary-instability growth rate using two different methods and show that the tertiary instability is essentially the primary drift-wave instability modified by the local $U''$. Then, depending on $U''$, the tertiary instability can be suppressed or unleashed. The former corresponds to the case when zonal flows are strong enough to suppress turbulence (Dimits regime), while the latter corresponds to the case when zonal flows are unstable and turbulence develops. This understanding is different from the traditional paradigm that turbulence is controlled by the flow shear $U'$. Our analytic predictions are in agreement with direct numerical simulations of the modified Terry--Horton system. ",physics

The suggestion is to define the $p_k^{\Delta_n}$-loci as elliptic functions with the right asymptotics at $\tau\to i\infty$. If this hypothesis is correct, one can move to substituting the Schur and Macdonald functions in the role of characters by the elliptic GNS and study their behavior at the deformed topological and $\Delta$ loci.

"  With the advent of quantum technology, nitrogen vacancy ($NV$) centers in diamond turn out to be a frontier which provides an efficient platform for quantum computation, communication and sensing applications. Due to the coupled spin-charge dynamics of the $NV$ system, knowledge about $NV$ charge state dynamics can help to formulate efficient spin control sequences strategically. Through this paper we report two spectroscopy-based deconvolution methods to create charge state mapping images of ensembles of $NV$ centers in diamond. First, relying on the fact that an off axis external magnetic field mixes the electronic spins and selectively modifies the photoluminescence (PL) of $NV^-$, we perform decomposition of the optical spectrum for an ensemble of $NV$s and extract the spectra for $NV^-$ and $NV^0$ states. Next, we introduce an optical filter based decomposition protocol and perform PL imaging for $NV^-$ and $NV^0$. Earlier obtained spectra for $NV^-$ and $NV^0$ states are used to calculate their transmissivities through a long pass optical filter. These results help us to determine the spatial distribution of the $NV$ charge states in a diamond sample. ",quantum physics
"  The finite time, $\tau_{\rm dep}$, over which positrons from $\beta^{+}$ decays of $^{56}$Co deposit energy in type Ia supernovae ejecta lead, in case the positrons are trapped, to a slower decay of the bolometric luminosity compared to an exponential decline. Significant light-curve flattening is obtained when the ejecta density drops below the value for which $\tau_{\rm dep}$ equals the $^{56}$Co life-time. We provide a simple method to accurately describe this ""delayed deposition"" effect, which is straightforward to use for analysis of observed light curves. We find that the ejecta heating is dominated by delayed deposition typically from 600 to 1200~day, and only later by longer lived isotopes $^{57}$Co and $^{55}$Fe decay (assuming solar abundance). For the relatively narrow $^{56}$Ni velocity distributions of commonly studied explosion models, the modification of the light curve depends mainly on the $^{56}$Ni mass-weighted average density, $\langle \rho \rangle t^{3}$. Accurate late-time bolometric light curves, which may be obtained with JWST far-infrared (far-IR) measurements, will thus enable to discriminate between explosion models by determining $\langle \rho \rangle t^3$ (and the $^{57}$Co and $^{55}$Fe abundances). The flattening of light curves inferred from recent observations, which is uncertain due to the lack of far-IR data, is readily explained by delayed deposition in models with $\langle \rho\rangle t^{3} \approx 0.2\,M_{\odot}\,(10^{4}\, \textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1})^{-3}$, and does not imply supersolar $^{57}$Co and $^{55}$Fe abundances.

"  Although convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieve high diagnostic accuracy for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, they are not yet applied in clinical routine. One important reason for this is a lack of model comprehensibility. Recently developed visualization methods for deriving CNN relevance maps may help to fill this gap. We investigated whether models with higher accuracy also rely more on discriminative brain regions predefined by prior knowledge. We trained a CNN for the detection of AD in N=663 T1-weighted MRI scans of patients with dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and verified the accuracy of the models via cross-validation and in three independent samples including N=1655 cases. We evaluated the association of relevance scores and hippocampus volume to validate the clinical utility of this approach. To improve model comprehensibility, we implemented an interactive visualization of 3D CNN relevance maps. Across three independent datasets, group separation showed high accuracy for AD dementia vs. controls (AUC$\geq$0.92) and moderate accuracy for MCI vs. controls (AUC$\approx$0.75). Relevance maps indicated that hippocampal atrophy was considered as the most informative factor for AD detection, with additional contributions from atrophy in other cortical and subcortical regions. Relevance scores within the hippocampus were highly correlated with hippocampal volumes (Pearson's r$\approx$-0.81). The relevance maps highlighted atrophy in regions that we had hypothesized a priori. This strengthens the comprehensibility of the CNN models, which were trained in a purely data-driven manner based on the scans and diagnosis labels. The high hippocampus relevance scores and high performance achieved in independent samples support the validity of the CNN models in the detection of AD-related MRI abnormalities.

"  We present the first census of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) complete down to 10$^6 M_{\odot}$ and within the inner 4 kpc of the nearest giant elliptical and powerful radio galaxy, Centaurus A.   We identified 689 GMCs using CO(1--0) data with 1"" spatial resolution ($\sim 20$ pc) and 2 km/s velocity resolution obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).   The $I$(CO)-$N$(H$_2$) conversion factor based on the virial method is $X_{\rm CO}$ = $(2 \pm 1 )\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$(K km/s)$^{-1}$ for the entire molecular disk, consistent with that of the disks of spiral galaxies including the Milky Way, and $X_{\rm CO}$ = $(5 \pm 2)\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$(K km/s)$^{-1}$ for the circumnuclear disk (CND, within a galactocentric radius of 200 pc).   We obtained the GMC mass spectrum distribution and find that the best-truncated power-law fit for the whole molecular disk, with index $\gamma \simeq -2.41 \pm 0.02$ and upper cutoff mass $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot}$, is also in agreement with that of nearby disk galaxies. A trend is found in the mass spectrum index from steep to shallow as we move to inner radii.   Although the GMCs are in an elliptical galaxy, the general GMC properties in the molecular disk are as in spiral galaxies. However, in the CND, large offsets in the line-width-size scaling relations ($\sim$ 0.3 dex higher than those in the GMCs in the molecular disk), a different $X_{\rm CO}$ factor, and the shallowest GMC mass distribution shape ($\gamma = -1.1 \pm 0.2$) all suggest that there the GMCs are most strongly affected by the presence of the AGN and/or shear motions.

"  This paper is part of a program to combine a staggered time and staggered spatial discretization of continuum mechanics problems so that any property of the continuum that is proved using vector calculus can be proven in an analogous way for the discretized system. We require that the discretizations be second order accurate and have a conserved quantity that approximates the energy for the system and guarantees stability for a reasonable constraint on the time step. We also require that the discretization is time explicit so as to avoid the solution of large system of possibly nonlinear algebraic equations. The well known Yee grid discretization of Maxwell's equations is the same as our discretization and is an early example of using a staggered space and time grid .   To motivate our discussion we begin by studying the staggered time or leapfrog discretization of the harmonic oscillator and use this to introduce the modification of the energy that is conserved. Next we use systems of linear equations to motivate the definition of the modified energy for more complex systems of ordinary differential equations and then apply our ideas to the scalar wave equation in one spatial dimension. We finish by discretizing the three dimensional scalar wave and Maxwell's equations. Because the spatial discretization is mimetic, we obtain that the divergence of the electric and magnetic fields are constant when there are no sources. Using the mimetic properties the proof of this trivial and is essentially the same as in the continuum. ",mathematics
"  Nanomechanical resonators are used in building ultra-sensitive mass and force sensors. In a widely used resonator based sensing paradigm, each modal resonance frequency is tracked with a phase-locked loop (PLL) based system. There is great interest in deciphering the fundamental sensitivity limitations due to inherent noise and fluctuations in PLL based resonant sensors to improve their performance. In this paper, we present a precise, first-principles based theory for the analysis of PLL based resonator tracking systems. Based on this theory, we develop a general, rigorously-derived noise analysis framework for PLL based sensors. We apply this framework to a setting where the sensor performance is mainly limited by the thermomechanical noise of the nanomechanical resonator. The results that are deduced through our analysis framework are in complete agreement with the ones we obtain from extensive, carefully run stochastic simulations of a PLL based sensor system. We compare the conclusions we derive with the recent results in the literature. Our theory and analysis framework can be used in assessing PLL based sensor performance with other sources of noise, e.g., from the electronic components, actuation and sensing mechanisms, and due to the signal generator, as well as for a variety of PLL based sensor configurations such as multi-mode and nonlinear sensing.

"  Shadowing trajectories are model trajectories consistent with a sequence of observations of a system, given a distribution of observational noise. The existence of such trajectories is a desirable property of any forecast model. Gradient descent of indeterminism is a well-established technique for finding shadowing trajectories in low-dimensional analytical systems. Here we apply it to the thermally-driven rotating annulus, a laboratory experiment intermediate in model complexity and physical idealisation between analytical systems and global, comprehensive atmospheric models. We work in the perfect model scenario using the MORALS model to generate a sequence of noisy observations in a chaotic flow regime. We demonstrate that the gradient descent technique recovers a pseudo-orbit of model states significantly closer to a model trajectory than the initial sequence. Gradient-free descent is used, where the adjoint model is set to $\lambda$I in the absence of a full adjoint model. The indeterminism of the pseudo-orbit falls by two orders of magnitude during the descent, but we find that the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the initial, true, model trajectory reaches a minimum and then diverges from truth. We attribute this to the use of the $\lambda$-adjoint, which is well suited to noise reduction but not to finely-tuned convergence towards a model trajectory. We find that $\lambda=0.25$ gives optimal results, and that candidate model trajectories begun from this pseudo-orbit shadow the observations for up to 80 s, about the length of the longest timescale of the system, and similar to expected shadowing times based on the distance between the pseudo-orbit and the truth. There is great potential for using this method with real laboratory data. ",physics

"  5G networks will provide the platform for deploying large number of tenant-associated management, control and end-user applications having different resource requirements at the infrastructure level.

In addition, it must ensure that resources can be scaled dynamically for the deployed slices when there is a demand for them from the deployed slices.

The policy agent learns to admit the most profitable slices in the network while ensuring their resource demands can be scaled elastically. We present the system model, the policy agent architecture and results from simulation study showing an increased revenue for infra-structure provider compared to other relevant slice admission strategies.

The second is based on the modular bootstrap program, and we propose a novel modular ansatz for the twisted elliptic genera that transform under the congruence subgroups $\Gamma_0(N)$ of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. We conjecture a vanishing bound for the refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds, upon which one can determine the twisted elliptic genera recursively.

"  Cosmological perturbation theory for the late Universe dominated by dark matter is extended beyond the perfect fluid approximation by taking the dark matter velocity dispersion tensor as an additional field into account. A proper tensor decomposition of the latter leads to two additional scalar fields, as well as a vector and a tensor field. Most importantly, the trace of the velocity dispersion tensor can have a spatially homogeneous and isotropic expectation value. While it decays at early times, we show that a back-reaction effect quadratic in perturbations makes it grow strongly at late times. We compare sterile neutrinos as a candidate for comparatively warm dark matter to weakly interacting massive particles as a rather cold dark matter candidate and show that the late time growth of velocity dispersion is stronger for the latter. Another feature of a non-vanishing velocity dispersion expectation value is that it destroys the apparent self-consistency of the single-stream approximation and allows thereby to treat times and scales beyond shell-crossing.

"  In this paper, we give a sharp analysis for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and prove that SGD is able to efficiently escape from saddle points and find an $(\epsilon, O(\epsilon^{0.5}))$-approximate second-order stationary point in $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ stochastic gradient computations for generic nonconvex optimization problems, when the objective function satisfies gradient-Lipschitz, Hessian-Lipschitz, and dispersive noise assumptions. This result subverts the classical belief that SGD requires at least $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic gradient computations for obtaining an $(\epsilon,O(\epsilon^{0.5}))$-approximate second-order stationary point. Such SGD rate matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor of problem-dependent parameters, the rate of most accelerated nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms that adopt additional techniques, such as Nesterov's momentum acceleration, negative curvature search, as well as quadratic and cubic regularization tricks. Our novel analysis gives new insights into nonconvex SGD and can be potentially generalized to a broad class of stochastic optimization algorithms. ",mathematics
"  In this paper we address the benefit of adding adversarial training to the task of monocular depth estimation. A model can be trained in a self-supervised setting on stereo pairs of images, where depth (disparities) are an intermediate result in a right-to-left image reconstruction pipeline. For the quality of the image reconstruction and disparity prediction, a combination of different losses is used, including L1 image reconstruction losses and left-right disparity smoothness. These are local pixel-wise losses, while depth prediction requires global consistency. Therefore, we extend the self-supervised network to become a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), by including a discriminator which should tell apart reconstructed (fake) images from real images. We evaluate Vanilla GANs, LSGANs and Wasserstein GANs in combination with different pixel-wise reconstruction losses. Based on extensive experimental evaluation, we conclude that adversarial training is beneficial if and only if the reconstruction loss is not too constrained. Even though adversarial training seems promising because it promotes global consistency, non-adversarial training outperforms (or is on par with) any method trained with a GAN when a constrained reconstruction loss is used in combination with batch normalisation. Based on the insights of our experimental evaluation we obtain state-of-the art monocular depth estimation results by using batch normalisation and different output scales.

"  The quantum logic gates used in the design of a quantum computer should be both universal, meaning arbitrary quantum computations can be performed, and fault-tolerant, meaning the gates keep errors from cascading out of control. A number of no-go theorems constrain the ways in which a set of fault-tolerant logic gates can be universal. These theorems are very restrictive, and conventional wisdom holds that a universal fault-tolerant logic gate set cannot be implemented natively, requiring us to use costly distillation procedures for quantum computation. Here, we present a general framework for universal fault-tolerant logic with stabiliser codes, together with a no-go theorem that reveals the very broad conditions constraining such gate sets. Our theorem applies to a wide range of stabiliser code families, including concatenated codes and conventional topological stabiliser codes such as the surface code. The broad applicability of our no-go theorem provides a new perspective on how the constraints on universal fault-tolerant gate sets can be overcome. In particular, we show how non-unitary implementations of logic gates provide a general approach to circumvent the no-go theorem, and we present a rich landscape of constructions for logic gate sets that are both universal and fault-tolerant. That is, rather than restricting what is possible, our no-go theorem provides a signpost to guide us to new, efficient architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. ",quantum physics
"  In this paper, a least-squares finite element method for scalar nonlinear hyperbolic balance laws is proposed and studied. The approach is based on a formulation that utilizes an appropriate Helmholtz decomposition of the flux vector and is related to the standard notion of a weak solution. This relationship, together with a corresponding connection to negative-norm least-squares, is described in detail. As a consequence, an important numerical conservation theorem is obtained, similar to the famous Lax-Wendroff theorem. The numerical conservation properties of the method in this paper do not fall precisely in the framework introduced by Lax and Wendroff, but they are similar in spirit as they guarantee that when $L^2$ convergence holds, the resulting approximations approach a weak solution to the hyperbolic problem. The least-squares functional is continuous and coercive in an $H^{-1}$-type norm, but not $L^2$-coercive. Nevertheless, the $L^2$ convergence properties of the method are discussed. Convergence can be obtained either by an explicit regularization of the functional, that provides control of the $L^2$ norm, or by properly choosing the finite element spaces, providing implicit control of the $L^2$ norm. Numerical results for the inviscid Burgers equation with discontinuous source terms are shown, demonstrating the $L^2$ convergence of the obtained approximations to the physically admissible solution. The numerical method utilizes a least-squares functional, minimized on finite element spaces, and a Gauss-Newton technique with nested iteration. We believe that the linear systems encountered with this formulation are amenable to multigrid techniques and combining the method with adaptive mesh refinement would make this approach an efficient tool for solving balance laws (this is the focus of a future study).

"  In this paper, a photovoltaic (PV) reconfigurable grid-tied inverter (RGTI) scheme is proposed. Unlike a conventional GTI that ceases operation during a power outage, the RGTI is designed to act as a regular GTI in the on-grid mode but it is reconfigured to function as a DC-DC charge-controller that continues operation during a grid outage. During this period, the RGTI is tied to the battery-bank of an external UPS based backup power system to augment it with solar power. Such an operation in off-grid mode without employing communication with the UPS is challenging, as the control of RGTI must not conflict with the battery management system of the UPS. The hardware and control design aspects of this requirement are discussed in this paper. A battery emulation control scheme is proposed for the RGTI that facilitates seamless functioning of the RGTI in parallel with the physical UPS battery to reduce its discharge current. A system-level control scheme for overall operation and power management is presented to handle the dynamic variations in solar irradiation and UPS loads during the day, such that the battery discharge burden is minimized. The design and operation of the proposed RGTI system are independent of the external UPS and can be integrated with an UPS supplied by any manufacturer.

Several deep learning based algorithms have been developed to solve this inverse problem and reconstruct the image using a limited number of projections. However these algorithms typically require examples of the ground-truth (i.e. examples of reconstructed images) to yield good performance. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised sparse-view backprojection algorithm, which does not require ground-truth. The algorithm consists of two modules in a generator-projector framework; a convolutional neural network and a spatial transformer network. We evaluated our algorithm using computed tomography (CT) images of the human chest. We show that our algorithm significantly out-performs filtered backprojection when the projection angles are very sparse, as well as when the sensor characteristics vary for different angles. Our approach has practical applications for medical imaging and other imaging modalities (e.g. radar) where sparse and/or non-uniform projections may be acquired due to time or sampling constraints.

"  We propose a neural network (NN) predictor and an adaptive mode selection scheme for the purpose of both improving secondary user's (SU's) throughput and reducing collision probability to the primary user (PU) in full-duplex (FD) cognitive networks. SUs can adaptively switch between FD transmission-and-reception (TR) and transmission-and-sensing (TS) modes based on the NN prediction results for each transmission duration. The prediction performance is then analysed in terms of prediction error probability. We also compare the performance of our proposed scheme with conventional TR and TS modes in terms of SUs average throughput and collision probability, respectively. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme achieves even better SUs average throughput compared with TR mode. Meanwhile, the collision probability can be reduced close to the level of TS mode.

"  In this work we consider quotients of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds by freely acting discrete groups and the associated physics of F-theory compactifications on such backgrounds. The process of quotienting a Calabi-Yau geometry produces not only new genus one fibered manifolds, but also new effective 6-dimensional physics. These theories can be uniquely characterized by the much simpler covering space geometry and the symmetry action on it. We use this method to construct examples of F-theory models with an array of discrete gauge groups and non-trivial monodromies, including an example with Z6 discrete symmetry.

"  One of the challenging problems in digital image forensics is the capability to identify images that are captured by the same camera device. This knowledge can help forensic experts in gathering intelligence about suspects by analyzing digital images. In this paper, we propose a two-part network to quantify the likelihood that a given pair of images have the same source camera, and we evaluated it on the benchmark Dresden data set containing 1851 images from 31 different cameras. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones addressing the challenge of device-based image matching. Though the proposed approach is not yet forensics ready, our experiments show that this direction is worth pursuing, achieving at this moment 85 percent accuracy.

"  A bicycle wheel that was initially spinning freely was placed in contact with a rough surface and a digital film was made of its motion. Using Tracker software for video analysis, we obtained the velocity vectors for several points on the wheel, in the frame of reference of the laboratory as well as in a relative frame of reference having as its origin the wheel`s center of mass. The velocity of the wheel`s point of contact with the floor was also determined obtaining then a complete picture of the kinematic state of the wheel in both frames of reference. An empirical approach of this sort to problems in mechanics can contribute to overcoming the considerable difficulties they entail. ",physics

"  We study the electromechanical transduction in nanoelectromechanical actuators and show that the differences in scaling for electrical and mechanical effects lead to an overall non-trivial scaling behavior. In particular, the previously neglected fringing fields considerably increase electrical forces and improve the stability of nanoscale actuators. This shows that electrostatics does not pose any limitations to downscaling of electromechanical systems, in fact in several respects, nanosystems outperform their microscale counterparts. As a specific example, we consider in-plane actuation of ultrathin slabs and show that devices consisting of a few layers of graphene are feasible, implying that electromechanical resonators operating beyond 40 GHz are possible with currently available technology.

"  In precision aquaculture, the primary goal is to maximize biomass production while minimizing production costs. This objective can be achieved by optimizing factors that have a strong influence on fish growth, such as the feeding rate, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. This paper provides a comparative study of three model predictive control (MPC) strategies for fish growth reference tracking under a representative bioenergetic growth model in precision aquaculture. We propose to evaluate three candidate MPC formulations for fish growth reference tracking based on the receding horizon. The first MPC formulation tracks a desired fish growth trajectory while penalizing the feed ration, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. The second MPC optimization strategy directly penalizes the feed conversion ratio (FCR), which is the ratio between food quantity and fish weight gain while minimizing the actual growth state's deviation from the given reference growth trajectory. The third MPC formulation includes a tradeoff between the growth rate trajectory tracking, the dynamic energy and the cost of food. Numerical simulations that integrate a realistic bioenergetic fish growth model of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) are illustrated to examine the comparative performance of the three proposed optimal control strategies.

"  We study a nonparametric Bayesian approach to estimation of the volatility function of a stochastic differential equation driven by a gamma process. The volatility function is modelled a priori as piecewise constant, and we specify a gamma prior on its values.

We give theoretical performance guarantees (contraction rates for the posterior) for the Bayesian estimate in terms of the regularity of the unknown volatility function. We illustrate the method on synthetic and real data examples. ",mathematics

We then define a $p$-typical and $\infty$-categorical version of H{\o}genhaven's $O(2)$-orthogonal cyclotomic spectra, construct a forgetful functor relating the two theories, and show that this functor restricts to an equivalence between full subcategories of appropriately bounded below objects.

"  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications appear as a promising candidate for future wireless systems due to its attractive advantages in terms of implementation cost and end-to-end system performance. In this paper, two new multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system designs using RISs are presented to enhance the performance and boost the spectral efficiency of state-of-the-art MIMO communication systems. Vertical Bell Labs layered space-time (VBLAST) and Alamouti's schemes have been considered in this study and RIS-based simple transceiver architectures are proposed. For the VBLAST-based new system, an RIS is used to enhance the performance of the nulling and canceling-based sub-optimal detection procedure as well as to noticeably boost the spectral efficiency by conveying extra bits through the adjustment of the phases of the RIS elements. In addition, RIS elements have been utilized in order to redesign Alamouti's scheme with a single radio frequency (RF) signal generator at the transmitter side and to enhance its bit error rate (BER) performance. Monte Carlo simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of our system designs and it has been shown that they outperform the reference schemes in terms of BER performance and spectral efficiency.

"  We use the spectroscopy and homogeneous photometry of 97 Type Ia supernovae obtained by the \emph{Carnegie Supernova Project} as well as a subset of 36 Type Ia supernovae presented by Zheng et al. (2018) to examine maximum-light correlations in a four-dimensional (4-D) parameter space: $B$-band absolute magnitude, $M_B$, \ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda6355$ velocity, \vsi, and \ion{Si}{2} pseudo-equivalent widths pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda6355$) and pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda5972$). It is shown using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) that the original four groups in the Branch diagram are well-defined and robust in this parameterization. We find three continuous groups that describe the behavior of our sample in [$M_B$, \vsi] space. Extending the GMM into the full 4-D space yields a grouping system that only slightly alters group definitions in the [$M_B$, \vsi] projection, showing that most of the clustering information in [$M_B$, \vsi] is already contained in the 2-D GMM groupings. However, the full 4-D space does divide group membership for faster objects between core-normal and broad-line objects in the Branch diagram. A significant correlation between $M_B$ and pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda5972$) is found, which implies that Branch group membership can be well-constrained by spectroscopic quantities alone. In general, we find that higher-dimensional GMMs reduce the uncertainty of group membership for objects between the originally defined Branch groups. We also find that the broad-line Branch group becomes nearly distinct with the inclusion of \vsi, indicating that this subclass of SNe Ia may be somehow different from the other groups.

"  In a recent work, we presented a discriminative backend for speaker verification that achieved good out-of-the-box calibration performance on most tested conditions containing varying levels of mismatch to the training conditions. This backend mimics the standard PLDA-based backend process used in most current speaker verification systems, including the calibration stage. All parameters of the backend are jointly trained to optimize the binary cross-entropy for the speaker verification task. Calibration robustness is achieved by making the parameters of the calibration stage a function of vectors representing the conditions of the signal, which are extracted using a model trained to predict condition labels. In this work, we propose a simplified version of this backend where the vectors used to compute the calibration parameters are estimated within the backend, without the need for a condition prediction model. We show that this simplified method provides similar performance to the previously proposed method while being simpler to implement, and having less requirements on the training data. Further, we provide an analysis of different aspects of the method including the effect of initialization, the nature of the vectors used to compute the calibration parameters, and the effect that the random seed and the number of training epochs has on performance. We also compare the proposed method with the trial-based calibration (TBC) method that, to our knowledge, was the state-of-the-art for achieving good calibration across varying conditions. We show that the proposed method outperforms TBC while also being several orders of magnitude faster to run, comparable to the standard PLDA baseline. ",electrical engineering and systems science

This method achieves average 0.5 spatial correlation for the whole predicted trajectory, and provide trained ODE parameter for further analysis. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We show that highly confined superfluid films are extremely nonlinear mechanical resonators, offering the prospect to realize a mechanical qubit. Specifically, we consider third-sound surface waves, with nonlinearities introduced by the van der Waals interaction with the substrate. Confining these waves to a disk, we derive analytic expressions for the cubic and quartic nonlinearities and determine the resonance frequency shifts they introduce. We predict single-phonon shifts that are three orders of magnitude larger than in current state-of-the-art nonlinear resonators. Combined with the exquisitely low intrinsic dissipation of superfluid helium and the strongly suppressed acoustic radiation loss in phononic crystal cavities, we predict that this could allow blockade interactions between phonons as well as two-level-system-like behavior. Our work provides a new pathway towards extreme mechanical nonlinearities, and towards quantum devices that use mechanical resonators as qubits. ",quantum physics
"  The Christy Gadget is the informal name for the plutonium device detonated in the Trinity test on July 16, 1945. In September 1944, Robert Christy, working in the theoretical implosion group, proposed a novel concept that altered the design of the nuclear core in Fat Man. While scientists originally intended to use a hollow sphere of plutonium, this design entailed substantial risk, due to the likelihood of asymmetries resulting from implosion. Christy proposed changing the design to a solid sphere of plutonium with a modulated neutron source, and the design was eventually adopted, tested at Trinity, and used in the attack on Nagasaki. While there is no question regarding the important role that Christy played in demonstrating its feasibility as a reliable design, there is a debate as to who initially proposed the idea; though most sources have attributed this invention to Christy, some historical sources have attributed credit to Christy's group leader, Rudolf Peierls, or indeed other scientists. This paper seeks to outline and resolve this dispute. We present new unclassified evidence extracted from previously unavailable sources (to unclassified audiences) from the National Security Research Center archives at Los Alamos National Laboratory. This evidence consists of 1945-1946 patent documentation, oral history interview tapes of Christy and Peierls, and monthly 1944 progress reports from the Theoretical Division. Though Christy and Peierls share joint credit on the patent, both Christy's and Peierls' words and writings, together with sources from Hans Bethe and Edward Teller, support the traditional view that Christy was indeed the originator of the idea. While Christy does deserve the majority of the credit for the invention and design, we acknowledge the important role Peierls and von Neumann played in its development. ",physics
"  Quantum digital signatures (QDS) exploit quantum laws to guarantee non-repudiation, unforgeability and transferability of messages with information-theoretic security. Current QDS protocols face two major restrictions, including the requirement of the symmetrization step with additional secure classical channels and quadratic scaling of the signature rate with the probability of detection events. Here, we present an efficient QDS protocol to overcome these issues by utilizing the classical post-processing operation called post-matching method. Our protocol does not need the symmetrization step, and the signature rate scales linearly with the probability of detection events. Simulation results show that the signature rate is three orders of magnitude higher than the original protocol in a 100-km-long fiber. This protocol is compatible with existing quantum communication infrastructure, therefore we anticipate that it will play a significant role in providing digital signatures with unconditional security.

"  We present a novel approach to generate higher-order initial conditions (ICs) for cosmological simulations that take into account the distinct evolution of baryons and dark matter. We focus on the numerical implementation and the validation of its performance, based on both collisionless N-body simulations and full hydrodynamic Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations. We improve in various ways over previous approaches that were limited to first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT). Specifically, we (1) generalize nth-order LPT to multi-fluid systems, allowing 2LPT or 3LPT ICs for two-fluid simulations, (2) employ a novel propagator perturbation theory to set up ICs for Eulerian codes that are fully consistent with 1LPT or 2LPT, (3) demonstrate that our ICs resolve previous problems of two-fluid simulations by using variations in particle masses that eliminate spurious deviations from expected perturbative results, (4) show that the improvements achieved by going to higher-order PT are comparable to those seen for single-fluid ICs, and (5) demonstrate the excellent (i.e., few per cent level) agreement between Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations, once high-quality initial conditions are used. The rigorous development of the underlying perturbation theory is presented in a companion paper. All presented algorithms are implemented in the Monofonic Music-2 package that we make publicly available. ",astrophysics

For the second integrator, we prove second-order convergence in Hrfor solutions in H^{r+3} with r > 1/2 and convergence in L2for solutions in H^3. Numerical results are reported to illustrate the established error estimates. The experiments clearly demonstrate that the new exponential-type integrators are favorable over classical exponential integrators for initial data with low regularity. ",mathematics
"  Device independent protocols based on Bell nonlocality, such as quantum key distribution and randomness generation, must ensure no adversary can have prior knowledge of the measurement outcomes. This requires a measurement independence assumption: that the choice of measurement is uncorrelated with any other underlying variables that influence the measurement outcomes. Conversely, relaxing measurement independence allows for a fully `causal' simulation of Bell nonlocality. We construct the most efficient such simulation, as measured by the mutual information between the underlying variables and the measurement settings, for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) scenario, and find that the maximal quantum violation requires a mutual information of just $\sim 0.080$ bits. Any physical device built to implement this simulation allows an adversary to have full knowledge of a cryptographic key or `random' numbers generated by a device independent protocol based on violation of the CHSH inequality. We also show that a previous model for the CHSH scenario, requiring only $\sim 0.046$ bits to simulate the maximal quantum violation, corresponds to the most efficient `retrocausal' simulation, in which future measurement settings necessarily influence earlier source variables. This may be viewed either as an unphysical limitation of the prior model, or as an argument for retrocausality on the grounds of its greater efficiency. Causal and retrocausal models are also discussed for maximally entangled two-qubit states, as well as superdeterministic, one-sided and zigzag causal models. ",quantum physics
"  When a Monte Carlo algorithm is used to evaluate a physical observable A, it is possible to slightly modify the algorithm so that it evaluates simultaneously A and the derivatives $\partial$ $\varsigma$ A of A with respect to each problem-parameter $\varsigma$. The principle is the following: Monte Carlo considers A as the expectation of a random variable, this expectation is an integral, this integral can be derivated as function of the problem-parameter to give a new integral, and this new integral can in turn be evaluated using Monte Carlo. The two Monte Carlo computations (of A and $\partial$ $\varsigma$ A) are simultaneous when they make use of the same random samples, i.e. when the two integrals have the exact same structure. It was proven theoretically that this was always possible, but nothing insures that the two estimators have the same convergence properties: even when a large enough sample-size is used so that A is evaluated very accurately, the evaluation of $\partial$ $\varsigma$ A using the same sample can remain inaccurate. We discuss here such a pathological example: null-collision algorithms are very successful when dealing with radiative transfer in heterogeneous media, but they are sources of convergence difficulties as soon as sensitivity-evaluations are considered. We analyse theoretically these convergence difficulties and propose an alternative solution. ",physics
"  This article concerns the development of the Vector Field Orientation - Active Disturbance Rejection (VFO-ADR) cascaded path-following controller for underactuated vehicles moving in a 3-dimensional space. The proposed concept of a cascaded control structure decouples system kinematics from system dynamics, resembling the approach utilized for nonholonomic systems. Thanks to the use of an ADR control approach in the dynamic-level controller, the proposed control structure is robust to even significant model uncertainties and external disturbances. Application of an error-based form of the Extended State Observer (ESO), implemented within the ADR inner-loop controller, implies the output-feedback characteristic of the control structure, i.e., only position and attitude of the vehicle body are expected to be measured. The kinematic-level controller is designed according to the VFO method utilizing the non-parametrized path representation to calculate the commanded velocities. The description of the proposed control structure is followed by the theoretical analysis utilizing the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) theorem and the simulation verification of the proposed solution.

"  The chromospheric Lyman-alpha line of neutral hydrogen (\lya; 1216\AA) is the strongest emission line in the solar spectrum. Fluctuations in \lya\ are known to drive changes in planetary atmospheres, although few instruments have had the ability to capture rapid \lya\ enhancements during solar flares. In this paper we describe flare-associated emissions via a statistical study of 477 M- and X-class flares as observed by the EUV Sensor on board the 15th Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, which has been monitoring the full-disk solar \lya\ irradiance on 10~s timescales over the course of Solar Cycle 24. The vast majority (95\%) of these flares produced \lya\ enhancements of 10\% or less above background levels, with a maximum increase of $\sim$30\%. The irradiance in \lya\ was found to exceed that of the 1-8 \AA\ X-ray irradiance by as much as two orders of magnitude in some cases, although flares that occurred closer to the solar limb were found to exhibit less of a \lya\ enhancement. This center-to-limb variation was verified through a joint, stereoscopic observation of an X-class flare that appeared near the limb as viewed from Earth, but close to disk center as viewed by the MAVEN spacecraft in orbit around Mars. The frequency distribution of peak \lya\ was found to have a power-law slope of $2.8\pm0.27$. We also show that increased \lya\ flux is closely correlated with induced currents in the ionospheric E-layer through the detection of the solar flare effect as observed by the Kakioka magnetometer.

"  I consider a sample of eight pressure-supported low-surface brightness galaxies (seven nearby dwarfs and one ultra-diffuse object) in terms of Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). These objects are modelled as Milgromian isotropic isothermal spheres characterised by two parameters that are constrained by observations: the constant line-of-sight velocity dispersion and the central surface density. The velocity dispersion determines the total mass, and, with the implied mass-to-light ratio, the central surface brightness. This then specifies the radial run of surface brightness over the entire isothermal sphere. For the objects in this sample the predicted radial distribution of surface brightness is shown to be entirely consistent with observations which constitutes a success for MOND that is independent of the reduced dynamical mass.

"  The large hierarchy between the quantum gravity and electroweak scales could be resolved by proposing the large extra dimensions with the fundamental Planck scale being of the order of the TeV scale.

In this paper, we will represent a resolution for the hierarchy problem where the inverse size of the extra dimension and the fundamental Planck scale would all be of the order of the TeV scale by proposing a fiber fabric of spacetime. Here, the origin of the large hierarchy is essentially due to the $\cosh$ function which is physically obtained from the dynamics of the horizontal metric in the vacuum of non-zero energy. In addition, the fiber fabric of spacetime allows to resolve the problems of the chirality fermions and stabilizing potential for the size of the extra dimension in an elegant and natural way, which are usually encountered in the higher dimensional theories. Then, we explore the inflation with the modulus of the extra dimension identified as the inflaton.

  We compute the tidal deformabilities for neutron star merger for equations of state with a strong first order phase transition producing a new separate branch in the mass-radius diagram.

It is demonstrated that the plot of the two tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ of the binary neutron star can show up to three separate branches. We propose that the future detections of neutron star merger events with the same value for $\Lambda_1$ but different values of $\Lambda_2$ serve as a signal for the existence of a strong first order phase transition in neutron star matter. ,astrophysics
"  Magnetic Induction (MI) is an efficient wireless communication method to deploy operational internet of underground things (IOUT) for oil and gas reservoirs. The IOUT consists of underground things which are capable of sensing the underground environment and communicating with the surface. The MI-based IOUT enable many applications, such as monitoring of the oil rigs, optimized fracturing, and optimized extraction. Most of these applications are dependent on the location of the underground things and therefore require accurate localization techniques. The existing localization techniques for MI-based underground sensing networks are two-dimensional and do not characterize the achievable accuracy of the developed methods which are both crucial and challenging tasks. Therefore, this paper presents the expression of the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) for three-dimensional MI-based IOUT localization which takes into account the channel parameters of the underground magnetic-induction. The derived CRLB provide the suggestions for an MI-based underground localization system by associating the system parameters with the error trend. Numerical results demonstrate that localization accuracy is affected by different channel and networks parameters such as the number of anchors, noise variance, frequency, and the number of underground things.

"  In the modern search for life elsewhere in the Universe, we are broadly looking for the following: the planets similar to Earth - physical indicators of habitability, and the manifestation of life - the biological signatures. A biosignature is a measured parameter that has a high probability of being caused by the living organisms, either atmospheric gas species or some surface features. Therefore, the focus of a search is on a product or phenomena produced by the living systems, mostly by microorganisms as these are the most abundant on our planet like, say, methane. However, we may need to distinguish the terms `biosignature' and `bioindicator'. A biosignature is what living organisms produce - a bioproduct, while a bioindicator may be anything necessary for life as we know it, such as water or a rocky planet. Oxygen in this case is a double biomarker; first, it is a byproduct of oxygenic photosynthesis and, second, it is a signature of a complex life, because complex highly organized life requires high levels of oxygen. It is possible that there are other such bioindicators. For example, in the atmospheric compositions of terrestrial planets in our Solar System (including Titan), argon is one of the major constituents, moreover it was recently acknowledged to be a `biologically' active gas, exhibiting organprotective and neuroprotective properties, especially under hypoxic conditions. Here we propose that argon in the atmosphere of a rocky planet is a bioindicator of a highly organized life, provided that the planet is already deemed potentially habitable: with water, atmosphere, and of a certain age allowing for the complex life to evolve. We also delineate its possible detection methods. ",physics

"  Wearable devices have been shown to effectively measure the head movement during impacts in sports like American football. When a head impact occurs, the device is triggered to collect and save the kinematic measurements during a predefined time window. Then, based on the collected kinematics, finite element (FE) head models can calculate brain strain, which is used to evaluate the risk of mild traumatic brain injury. To find a time window that can provide a sufficient duration of kinematics for FE analysis, we investigated 118 on-field video-confirmed head impacts collected by the Stanford Instrumented Mouthguard. Because the individual differences in brain geometry influence these calculations, we included six representative brain geometries and found that larger brains need a longer time window of kinematics for accurate calculation. Among the different sizes of brains, a pre-trigger time of 20 ms and a post-trigger time of 70 ms were found to yield calculations of brain strain and strain rate that were not significantly different from calculations using the original 200 ms time window recorded by the mouthguard.

  We study non-perturbative instabilities of AdS spacetime in General Relativity with a cosmological constant in arbitrary dimensions. In this simple setup we explicitly construct a class of gravitational instantons generalizing Witten's bubble of nothing. We calculate the corresponding Euclidean action and show that its change is finite. The expansion of these bubbles is described by a lower-dimensional de Sitter geometry within a non-compact foliation of the background spacetime. Moreover we discuss the existence of covariantly constant spinors as a possible topological obstruction for such decays to occur. This mechanism is further connected to the stability of supersymmetric vacua in string theory. ,high energy physics theory
"  We develop a systematic method to construct the Bell states of a qubit bipartite system while taking $SU(2)$ group as the basis group. An alternative formulation of fidelity, called $SU(2)$ fidelity, is proposed which gives the Bell-CHSH inequality. Taking analogy from the octet theory governed by the $SU(3)$ group, it is shown that the method can be easily generalized to derive all possible entangled states and the $SU(3)$ fidelity of the higher dimensional bipartite qutrit system. The properties of these states are studied which reveal the existence of some inequalities for the qutrit bipartite system. ",quantum physics
"  Following the idea of Alekseev and Shatashvili we derive the path integral quantization of a modified relativistic particle action that results in the Feynman propagator of a free field with arbitrary spin. This propagator can be associated with the Duffin, Kemmer, and Petiau (DKP) form of a free field theory. We show explicitly that the obtained DKP propagator is equivalent to the standard one, for spins 0 and 1. We argue that this equivalence holds also for higher spins. ",high energy physics theory
"  Stellar winds of cool carbon stars enrich the interstellar medium with significant amounts of carbon and dust. We present a study of the influence of two-fluid flow on winds where we add descriptions of frequency-dependent radiative transfer. Our radiation hydrodynamic models in addition include stellar pulsations, grain growth and ablation, gas-to-dust drift using one mean grain size, dust extinction based on both the small particle limit and Mie scattering, and an accurate numerical scheme. We calculate models at high spatial resolution using 1024 gridpoints and solar metallicities at 319 frequencies, and we discern effects of drift by comparing drift models to non-drift models. Our results show differences of up to 1000 per cent in comparison to extant results. Mass-loss rates and wind velocities of drift models are typically, but not always, lower than in non-drift models. Differences are larger when Mie scattering is used instead of the small particle limit. Amongst other properties, the mass-loss rates of the gas and dust, dust-to-gas density ratio, and wind velocity show an exponential dependence on the dust-to-gas speed ratio. Yields of dust in the least massive winds increase by a factor four when drift is used. We find drift velocities in the range 10-67 km/s, which is drastically higher than in our earlier works that use grey radiative transfer. It is necessary to include an estimate of drift velocities to reproduce high yields of dust and low wind velocities. ",astrophysics
"  The critical component of radio astronomy radiometers built to detect redshifted 21-cm signals from Cosmic Dawn is the antenna element. We describe the design and performance of an octave bandwidth cone disc antenna built to detect this signal in the band 40 to 90 MHz. The Cosmic Dawn signal is predicted to be a wideband spectral feature orders of magnitude weaker than sky and ground radio brightness. Thus, the engineering challenge is to design an antenna at low frequencies that is able to provide with high fidelity the faint cosmological signal, along with foreground sky, to the receiver. The antenna characteristics must not compromise detection by imprinting any confusing spectral features on the celestial radiation, ground emission or receiver noise. An innovation in the present design is making the antenna electrically smaller than half wavelength and operating it on the surface of a sufficiently large water body. The homogeneous and high permittivity medium beneath the small cone-disc antenna results in an achromatic beam pattern, high radiation efficiency and minimum unwanted confusing spectral features. The antenna design was optimized in WIPL-D and FEKO. A prototype was constructed and deployed on a lake to validate its performance with field measurements.

"  Ultracold collisions of Bose-Einstein condensates can be used to generate a large number of counterpropagating pairs of entangled atoms, which collectively form a thin spherical shell in momentum space, called a scattering halo. Here we generate a scattering halo composed almost entirely of pairs in a symmetric entangled state and observe a scattering angle-dependent mixing to the anti-symmetric state due to the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field. We report on a proof-of-principle application of the observed parity dynamics to demonstrate magnetic gradiometry, insensitive to common-mode fluctuations of the background magnetic field. Furthermore, the highly multimode nature and narrow radial width of the scattering halos enable 3D tomography of an interrogated field without the need for a scanning probe. ",quantum physics
"  When using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for segmentation of organs and lesions in medical images, the conventional approach is to work with inputs and outputs either as single slice (2D) or whole volumes (3D). One common alternative, in this study denoted as pseudo-3D, is to use a stack of adjacent slices as input and produce a prediction for at least the central slice. This approach gives the network the possibility to capture 3D spatial information, with only a minor additional computational cost. In this study, we systematically evaluate the segmentation performance and computational costs of this pseudo-3D approach as a function of the number of input slices, and compare the results to conventional end-to-end 2D and 3D CNNs. The standard pseudo-3D method regards the neighboring slices as multiple input image channels. We additionally evaluate a simple approach where the input stack is a volumetric input that is repeatably convolved in 3D to obtain a 2D feature map. This 2D map is in turn fed into a standard 2D network. We conducted experiments using two different CNN backbone architectures and on five diverse data sets covering different anatomical regions, imaging modalities, and segmentation tasks. We found that while both pseudo-3D methods can process a large number of slices at once and still be computationally much more efficient than fully 3D CNNs, a significant improvement over a regular 2D CNN was only observed for one of the five data sets. An analysis of the structural properties of the segmentation masks revealed no relations to the segmentation performance with respect to the number of input slices. The conclusion is therefore that in the general case, multi-slice inputs appear to not significantly improve segmentation results over using 2D or 3D CNNs.

"  An array of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice (Mott insulator) excited to a state where single electron wave-functions spatially overlap would represent a new and ideal platform to simulate exotic electronic many-body phenomena in the condensed phase. However, this highly excited non-equilibrium system is expected to be so short-lived that it has eluded observation so far. Here, we demonstrate the first step toward its realization by exciting high-lying electronic (Rydberg) states of the atomic Mott insulator with a coherent ultrashort laser pulse. Beyond a threshold principal quantum number where Rydberg orbitals of neighboring lattice sites overlap with each other, the atoms efficiently undergo spontaneous Penning ionization resulting in a drastic change of ion-counting statistics, sharp increase of avalanche ionization and the formation of an ultracold plasma. These observations signal the actual creation of exotic electronic states with overlapping wave functions, which is further confirmed by a significant difference in ionization dynamics between a Bose-Einstein condensate and a Mott insulator.

"  Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely used for clinical diagnosis. As PET suffers from low resolution and high noise, numerous efforts try to incorporate anatomical priors into PET image reconstruction, especially with the development of hybrid PET/CT and PET/MRI systems. In this work, we proposed a novel 3D structural convolutional sparse coding (CSC) concept for penalized-likelihood PET image reconstruction, named 3D PET-CSC. The proposed 3D PET-CSC takes advantage of the convolutional operation and manages to incorporate anatomical priors without the need of registration or supervised training. As 3D PET-CSC codes the whole 3D PET image, instead of patches, it alleviates the staircase artifacts commonly presented in traditional patch-based sparse coding methods. Moreover, we developed the residual-image and order-subset mechanisms to further reduce the computational cost and accelerate the convergence for the proposed 3D PET-CSC method. Experiments based on computer simulations and clinical datasets demonstrate the superiority of 3D PET-CSC compared with other reference methods. ",physics
"  In the present work we investigate the r-mode instability windows, spindown and spindown rates of sub- and super-Chandrasekhar magnetized white dwarfs in presence of Landau quantization of the electron gas and magnetic braking. The gravitational wave strain amplitudes due to r-mode instability is also calculated. The dominant damping mechanism is taken to be the shear viscosity arising due to scattering of the degenerate electrons from the ion liquid. We find that the critical frequencies of Landau quantized magnetized white dwarfs are the lowest, those of non-Landau quantized ones are higher and those of non-magnetized ones are the highest at the same temperature. This implies that magnetic braking and Landau quantization both enhance r-mode instability. We have also seen that there is rapid spindown of magnetized white dwarfs due to additional magnetic braking term but there is no considerable effect of Landau quantization on the spindown and spindown rates for magnetic field strengths relevant for white dwarf interiors. We find that the r-mode gravitational wave strain amplitude for a rapidly rotating super-Chandrasekhar white dwarf at 1 kpc is $\sim 10^{-27}$, making isolated massive rapidly rotating hot magnetized white dwarfs prime candidates for search of gravitational waves in the future.

"  Quantification of metabolites from magnetic resonance spectra (MRS) has many applications in medicine and psychology, but remains a challenging task despite considerable research efforts. For example, the neurotransmitter $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), present in very low concentration in vivo, regulates inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain and is involved in several processes outside the brain. Reliable quantification is required to determine its role in various physiological and pathological conditions. We present a novel approach to quantification of metabolites from MRS with convolutional neural networks --- MRSNet. MRSNet is trained to perform the multi-class regression problem of identifying relative metabolite concentrations from given input spectra, focusing specifically on the quantification of GABA, which is particularly difficult to resolve. Typically it can only be detected at all using special editing acquisition sequences such as MEGA-PRESS. A large range of network structures, data representations and automatic processing methods are investigated. Results are benchmarked using experimental datasets from test objects of known composition and compared to state-of-the-art quantification methods: LCModel, jMRUI (AQUES, QUEST), TARQUIN, VeSPA and Gannet. The results show that the overall accuracy and precision of metabolite quantification is improved using convolutional neural networks. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We propose an expression for the classical limit of diagonal form factors in which we integrate the corresponding observable over the moduli space of classical solutions. In infinite volume the integral has to be regularized by proper subtractions and we present the one, which corresponds to the classical limit of the connected diagonal form factors. In finite volume the integral is finite and can be expressed in terms of the classical infinite volume diagonal form factors and subvolumes of the moduli space. We analyze carefully the periodicity properties of the finite volume moduli space and found a classical analogue of the Bethe-Yang equations. By applying the results to the heavy-heavy-light three point functions we can express their strong coupling limit in terms of the classical limit of the sine-Gordon diagonal form factors.

"  Optical whispering-gallery-mode microresonators with ultrahigh quality factors and small mode volumes have played an important role in modern physics. They have been demonstrated as a diverse platform for a wide range of photonics applications, such as nonlinear optics, optomechanics, quantum optics, and information processing. Thermal behaviors induced by power buildup in resonators or environmental perturbations are ubiquitous in high-quality-factor whispering-gallery-mode resonators and have played an important role in their operation for various applications. Here in this review, we discuss the mechanisms of laser field induced thermal nonlinear effects, including thermal bistability and thermal oscillation. With the help of the thermal bistability effect, optothermal spectroscopy and optical non-reciprocity have been demonstrated. On the other hand, by tuning the temperature of the environment, the resonant mode frequency will shift, which could also be used for thermal sensing/tuning applications. Thermal locking technique and thermal imaging mechanisms are discussed briefly. Last, we review some techniques to realize thermal stability in a high-quality-factor resonator system. ",physics

The proof uses mainly integrations by parts. ",mathematics
"  We study decays of a spin $1$ boson within the formalism of Hagen-Hurley equations. Such particle can decay into two spin $\frac{1}{2}$ particles, a Weyl neutrino and a massive fermion, whose spins can couple to $S=0$ or $S=1$. Since spin $0$ and spin $1$ bosons can be described by the Dirac equation within the same representation of $\gamma ^{\mu }$ matrices mixing of $S=0$ and $S=1$ states is possible. We argue that the Hagen-Hurley equations describe $W$ boson with spin $S\in 0\oplus 1$ space and analyse mixed beta decays as well as top quark decays from this perspective. ",physics
"  This paper reviews recent literature results on the mechanics of structures formed by layers of pentamode lattices alternating with stiffening plates, which can be effectively employed for the development of seismic isolation devices and vibration attenuation tools, with nearly complete band gaps for shear waves. It is shown that such structures, named pentamode bearings, can respond either in the stretching-dominated regime, or in the bending-dominated regime, depending on the nature of the joints connecting the different members. Their response is characterized by high vertical stiffness and theoretically zero shear stiffness in the stretching dominated regime, or considerably low values of such a quantity in the bending dominated regime. Available results on the experimental response of 3d printed models to combined compression and shear loading highlight that the examined structures are able to exhibit energy dissipation capacity and effective damping that are suitable for seismic isolation devices. Their fabrication does not necessarily require heavy industry, and expensive materials, being possible with ordinary 3-D printers. ",physics
"  Using Monte-Carlo computer simulations, we study the impact of matter fields on the geometry of a typical quantum universe in the CDT model of lattice quantum gravity. The quantum universe has the size of a few Planck lengths and the spatial topology of a three-torus. The matter fields are multi-component scalar fields taking values in a torus with circumference $\delta$ in each spatial direction, which acts as a new parameter in the CDT model. Changing $\delta$, we observe a phase transition caused by the scalar field. This discovery may have important consequences for quantum universes with non-trivial topology, since the phase transition can change the topology to a simply connected one.

"  In contrast with imaging using position-resolving cameras, single-pixel imaging uses a bucket detector along with spatially structured illumination for image recovery. This emerging imaging technique is a promising candidate for a broad range of applications due to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity, and applicability in a wide range of frequency bands. Here, inspired by single-pixel imaging in the spatial domain, we demonstrate a temporal single-pixel imaging (TSPI) system that covers frequency bands including both terahertz (THz) and near-infrared (NIR) region. By implementing a programmable temporal fan-out (TFO) gate based on a digital micromirror device (DMD), we can deterministically prepare temporally structured pulses with a temporal sampling size down to 16.00$\pm$0.01 fs. By inheriting the advantages in detection efficiency and sensitivity from spatial single-pixel imaging, TSPI enables the compressive recovery of a 5 fJ THz pulse and two NIR pulses with over 97$\%$ fidelity. We demonstrate that the TSPI is robust against temporal distortions in the probe pulse train as well. As a direct application, we apply TSPI to machine-learning-aided THz spectroscopy and demonstrate a high sample identification accuracy (97.5$\%$) even under low SNRs (SNR $\sim$ 10). ",physics
"  Bootstrap percolation is a class of cellular automata with random initial state. Two-dimensional bootstrap percolation models have three rough universality classes, the most studied being the `critical' one. For this class the scaling of the quantity of greatest interest -- the critical probability -- was determined by Bollob\'as, Duminil-Copin, Morris and Smith in terms of a simply defined combinatorial quantity called `difficulty', so the subject seemed closed up to finding sharper results. However, the computation of the difficulty, was never considered. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to determine this quantity, which is, surprisingly, not as easy as the definition leads to thinking. The proof also provides some explicit upper bounds, which are of use for bootstrap percolation. On the other hand, we also prove the negative result that computing the difficulty of a critical model is NP-hard. This two-dimensional picture contrasts with an upcoming result of Balister, Bollob\'as, Morris and Smith on uncomputability in higher dimensions. The proof of NP-hardness is achieved by a technical reduction to the Set Cover problem. ",mathematics
"  Functional MRI (fMRI) is commonly used for interpreting neural activities across the brain. Numerous accelerated fMRI techniques aim to provide improved spatiotemporal resolutions. Among these, simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) imaging has emerged as a powerful strategy, becoming a part of large-scale studies, such as the Human Connectome Project. However, when SMS imaging is combined with in-plane acceleration for higher acceleration rates, conventional SMS reconstruction methods may suffer from noise amplification and other artifacts. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained interest for improving MRI reconstruction. However, these methods are typically trained in a supervised manner that necessitates fully-sampled reference data, which is not feasible in highly-accelerated fMRI acquisitions. Self-supervised learning that does not require fully-sampled data has recently been proposed and has shown similar performance to supervised learning. However, it has only been applied for in-plane acceleration. Furthermore the effect of DL reconstruction on subsequent fMRI analysis remains unclear. In this work, we extend self-supervised DL reconstruction to SMS imaging. Our results on prospectively 10-fold accelerated 7T fMRI data show that self-supervised DL reduces reconstruction noise and suppresses residual artifacts. Subsequent fMRI analysis remains unaltered by DL processing, while the improved temporal signal-to-noise ratio produces higher coherence estimates between task runs.

"  In the present paper, we study the relationship between deformation quantizations and Frobenius-projective structures defined on an algebraic curve in positive characteristic. A Frobenius-projective structure is an analogue of a complex projective structure on a Riemann surface, which was introduced by Y. Hoshi. Such an additional structure has some equivalent objects, e.g., a dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-oper and a projective connection having a full set of solutions. The main result of the present paper provides a canonical construction of a Frobenius-constant quantization on the cotangent space minus the zero section on an algebraic curve by means of a Frobenius-projective structure. It may be thought of as a positive characteristic analogue of a result by D. Ben-Zvi and I. Biswas. Finally, we give a higher-dimensional variant of this result, as proved by I. Biswas in the complex case. ",mathematics
"  We elucidate some exact relations between light-cone and covariant string field theories on the basis of the homological perturbation lemma for $A_{\infty }$. The covariant string field splits into the light-cone string field and trivial excitations of BRST quartets: The latter generates the gauge symmetry and covariance. We first show that the reduction of gauge degrees can be performed by applying the lemma, which gives a refined version of the no-ghost theorem of covariant strings. Then, we demonstrate that after the reduction, gauge-fixed theory can be regarded as a kind of effective field theory and it provides an exact gauge-fixing procedure taking into account interactions. As a result, a novel light-cone string field theory is obtained from Witten's open string field theory. ",high energy physics theory

"  W49B is a supernova remnant (SNR) discovered over 60 years ago in early radio surveys. It has since been observed over the entire wavelength range, with the X-ray morphology resembling a centrally-filled SNR. The nature of its progenitor star is still debated. Applying Smoothed Particle Inference techniques to analyze the X-Ray emission from W49B, we characterize the morphology and abundance distribution over the entire remnant. We also infer the density structure and derive the mass of individual elements present in the plasma. The morphology is consistent with an interaction between the remnant and a dense medium along the eastern edge, and some obstruction towards the west. We find a total mass of 130 $(\pm 16)$ M$_{\odot}$ and an estimated ejecta mass of 1.2 $(\pm 0.2)$ M$_{\odot}$. Comparison of the inferred abundance values and individual element masses with a wide selection of SN models suggests that deflagration-to-detonation (DDT) Type Ia models are the most compatible, with Fe abundance being the major discriminating factor. The general agreement between our abundance measurements and those from previous studies suggests that disagreement between various authors is more likely due to the choice of models used for comparison, rather than the abundance values themselves. While our abundance results lean toward a Type Ia origin, ambiguities in the interpretation of various morphological and spectral characteristics of W49B do not allow us to provide a definitive classification.

"  Reducing the intrinsic emittance of photocathodes is one of the most promising routes to improving the brightness of electron sources. However, when emittance growth occurs during beam transport (for example, due to space-charge), it is possible that this emittance growth overwhelms the contribution of the photocathode and, thus, in this case source emittance improvements are not beneficial. Using multi-objective genetic optimization, we investigate the role intrinsic emittance plays in determining the final emittance of several space-charge dominated photoinjectors, including those for high repetition rate free electron lasers and ultrafast electron diffraction. We introduce a new metric to predict the scale of photocathode emittance improvements that remain beneficial and explain how additional tuning is required to take full advantage of new photocathode technologies. Additionally, we determine the scale of emittance growth due to point-to-point Coulomb interactions with a fast tree-based space-charge solver. Our results show that in the realistic high brightness photoinjector applications under study, the reduction of thermal emittance to values as low as 50 pm/um (1 meV MTE) remains a viable option for the improvement of beam brightness.

"  The isotopic ratio of nitrogen measured in primitive Solar System bodies shows a broad range of values, the origin of which remains unknown. One key question is whether these isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen predate the comet formation stage or are posterior to it. Another central question is elucidating the processes that can produce the observed variations in the 14N/15N isotopic ratio. Disks that orbit pre-main-sequence stars provide unique opportunities for observing the chemical content of analogs of the protosolar nebula and therefore for building a comprehensive scenario for the origin of nitrogen in the Solar System and in planet-forming disks. We present spectrally and spatially resolved observations of the hyperfine structure of the 4-3 rotational transition of HCN and its main isotopologs H13CN and HC15N in the disk orbiting the 8 Myr old TTauri star TW Hya. The spatially averaged HCN/H13CN and HCN/HC15N abundance ratios are 86+/-4 and 223+/-21, respectively. The latter value is significantly lower than the CN:C15N ratio 323+/-30 in this disk and thus provides the first evidence that two isotopic reservoirs of nitrogen are present in a disk at the stage of giant planet and comet formation. Furthermore, we find clear evidence for an increase in the ratio of HCN to HC15N with radius. The ratio in the outer disk is 339+/-28, in excellent agreement with direct measurements in the local interstellar medium, and with the bulk nitrogen isotopic ratio predicted from galactic evolution calculations. In the comet formation region at r=20 au, the ratio is a factor ~3 lower, 121+/-11. This radial increase qualitatively agrees with the scenario in which selective photodissociation of N 2 is the dominant fractionation process. However, our isotopic ratios and kinetic temperature of the HCN-emitting layers quantitatively disagree with models of nitrogen chemistry in disks. ",astrophysics

We compare their performance against a model predictive controller in presence of sensor noise and persistent faults. The controllers are tested on a fuel tank model of a C-130 plane.

"  The artificial noise (AN) aided multi-beam directional modulation (DM) technology is capable of wireless physical layer secure (PLS) transmissions for multiple desired receivers in free space. The application of AN, however, makes it less power-efficient for such a DM system.

"  The surface modification of 2D semiconducting materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), is becoming important for a diverse range of applications, such as biosensing, catalysis, energy generation and energy storage. Due to the chemical inertness of their basal plane, the surface modification of 2D TMDCs is mainly limited to their defective sites, or it requires a conversion of TMDC from its semiconducting into a metallic phase. In this work, we show that the basal plane of a 2D semiconductor molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can be modified by electrochemical grafting of aryl-diazonium salt, such as 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. To investigate the applicability of this method, we perform electrografting on MoS2 nanoribbons by addressing them individually via a different electrode. High spatial selectivity of this method on the nanoscale opens the possibility for specific surface modification of neighboring 2D layers and nanostructures that are contacted by electrodes. This method could be potentially applicable to other 2D semiconducting materials that are active in the same potential window in which the electrochemical reduction of aryl diazonium salts occurs.

The AMS data reveal a remarkable long-term behavior in the temporal evolution of the proton-to-helium ratio at rigidity $R = p/Z <$ 3 GV. As we have argued in a recent work, such a behavior may reflect the transport properties of low-rigidity CRs in the inteplanetary space. In particular, it can be caused by mass/charge dependence of the CR diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we present our developments in the numerical modeling of CR transport in the Milky Way and in the heliosphere. Within our model, and with the help of approximated analytical solutions, we describe in details the relations between the properties of CR diffusion and the time-dependent evolution of the proton-to-helium ratio.

"  For a variety of on-going and planned gravitational-wave (GW) experiments, we study expected constraints on the fraction ($f_{\rm PBH}$) of primordial black holes (PBHs) in dark matter by evaluating the energy-density spectra of two kinds of stochastic GW backgrounds. The first one is produced from an incoherent superposition of GWs emitted from coalescences of all the binary PBHs. The second one is induced through non-linear mode couplings of large primordial curvature perturbations inevitably associated with the generation of PBHs in the early Universe. In this paper, we focus on the PBHs with their masses of $10^{-8}M_{\odot}\leq M_{\mathrm{PBH}} < 1M_{\odot}$, since they are not expected to be of a stellar origin. In almost all ranges of the masses, we show that the experiments are sensitive to constrain the fraction for $10^{-5} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 1$ by considering the GWs from coalescing events and $10^{-13} \lesssim f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 1$ by considering the GWs from curvature perturbations. Exceptionally, only in a narrow range of masses for $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-7} M_{\odot}$, the fraction cannot be constrained for $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 10^{-13}$ by those two GW backgrounds.

"  Optical nanocavities for coherent interfaces usually have their electric field maximum at the center point, which normally benefits interactions with small local quantum emitters. Here, we propose a partial thickness modulation on 2D slab photonic crystal cavities for a cratered cavity mode function to improve nonlocal interactions. The thickness modulation is applied around the central region, and has little effect on the fringe electric field, which determines the coupling to waveguides or other cavities. Furthermore, the partial modulation enhances the cratered electric field at positions that are distant from the center point. Therefore, interactions with multiple separated emitters are simultaneously enhanced, and the interaction with a large emitter beyond the dipole approximation is also doubled. The improvement of the nonlocal interactions demonstrates a great potential for the cratered cavity mode profile for applications in quantum photonic networks. ",physics
"  We construct a background for M-theory that is moduli free. This background is then shown to be related to a topological phase of the $\mathrm{E}_{8(8)}$ exceptional field theory (ExFT). The key ingredient in the construction is the embedding of non-Riemannian geometry in ExFT. This allows one to describe non-relativistic geometries, such as Newton-Cartan or Gomis-Ooguri-type limits, using the ExFT framework originally developed to describe maximal supergravity. This generalises previous work by Morand and Park in the context of double field theory. ",high energy physics theory
"  One-parameter functionals of the R\'{e}nyi $R_{\rho,\gamma}(\alpha)$ and Tsallis $T_{\rho,\gamma}(\alpha)$ types are calculated both in the position (subscript $\rho$) and momentum ($\gamma$) spaces for the azimuthally symmetric 2D nanoring that is placed into the combination of the transverse uniform magnetic field $\bf B$ and the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux $\phi_{AB}$ and whose potential profile is modelled by the superposition of the quadratic and inverse quadratic dependencies on the radius $r$. Position (momentum) R\'{e}nyi entropy depends on the field $B$ as a negative (positive) logarithm of $\omega_{eff}\equiv\left(\omega_0^2+\omega_c^2/4\right)^{1/2}$, where $\omega_0$ determines the quadratic steepness of the confining potential and $\omega_c$ is a cyclotron frequency. This makes the sum ${R_\rho}_{nm}(\alpha)+{R_\gamma}_{nm}(\frac{\alpha}{2\alpha-1})$ a field-independent quantity that increases with the principal $n$ and azimuthal $m$ quantum numbers and does satisfy corresponding uncertainty relation. Analytic expression for the lower boundary of the semi-infinite range of the dimensionless coefficient $\alpha$ where the momentum entropies exist reveals that it depends on the ring geometry, AB intensity and quantum number $m$. It is proved that there is the only orbital for which both R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis uncertainty relations turn into the identity at $\alpha=1/2$ and which is not necessarily the lowest-energy level. At any coefficient $\alpha$, the dependence of the position R\'{e}nyi entropy on the AB flux mimics the energy variation with $\phi_{AB}$ what, under appropriate scaling, can be used for the unique determination of the associated persistent current. Similarities and differences between the two entropies and their uncertainty relations are discussed too. ",quantum physics

"  Lift-off of sensor affects the prediction of electromagnetic properties for both ferrous and non-ferrous steel plates. In this paper, we developed a strategy to address this issue for ferrous plates. With increased lift-off, the phase of the measured impedance for steel plates reduces. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the impedance signal decreases. Based on these facts, a phase compensation algorithm is developed which corrects the phase change due to lift-off considering the magnitude of the impedance signal. Further, a new magnetic permeability prediction technique is presented, which has been validated by analytical and measured results. With this new technique, the error in permeability prediction is less than 2% within the range of lift-offs tested. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Using a currently most representative sample of 477 late-type galaxies within 11 Mpc of the Milky Way with measured star-formation rates ($SFR$s) from the far ultraviolet ($FUV$) and H$\alpha$ emission line fluxes, we select galaxies with the extreme ratios: $SFR(H\alpha)/SFR(FUV) > 2$ and $SFR(H\alpha)/SFR(FUV) < 1/20$. Each subsample amounts to $\sim5$\% of the total number and consists of dwarf galaxies with the stellar masses $M^*/M_{\odot} = (5.5 - 9.5)$~dex. In spite of a huge difference in their $SFR(H\alpha)$ activity on a scale of $\sim10$~ Myr, the temporarily ""excited"" and temporarily ""quiescent"" galaxies follow one and the same relation between $SFR(FUV)$ and $M^*$ on a scale of $\sim100$~Myr. Their average specific star-formation rate $\log[SFR(FUV)/M^*] = -10.1\pm0.1$ (yr$^{-1}$) coinsides with the Hubble parameter $\log(H_0)= -10.14$ (yr$^{-1}$). On a scale of $t \sim10$~Myr, variations of $SFR$ have a moderate flash amplitude of less than 1 order above the main-sequence and a fading amplitude to 2 orders below the average level. In general, both temporarily excited and temporarily quiescent galaxies have almost similar gas fractions as normal main-sequence galaxies, being able to maintain the current rate of star-formation on another Hubble time scale. Ranging the galaxies according to the density contrast produced by the nearest massive neighbor exhibits only a low average excess of $SFR$ caused by tidal interactions. ",astrophysics
"  We consider resolutions of codimension-two enhanced singularities from $SO(12)$ to $E_7$ and from $E_7$ to $E_8$ in six-dimensional F-theory, where a half-hypermultiplet arises for generic complex structures achieving them. The exceptional fibers at the enhanced point exhibit different structures depending on how the colliding 7-brane approaches the stack of gauge 7-branes, as previously observed by Morrison and Taylor in the case of the enhancement from $SU(6)$ to $E_6$. When the colliding brane approaches them as $O(s)$, where $s$ is the coordinate of the base space along the gauge 7-branes, the resolution process ends up with fewer exceptional fibers than naively expected from the Kodaira classification, with a non-Dynkin intersection matrix including half-integral intersection numbers. We confirm that the exceptional fibers at the enhanced point form extremal rays of the cone of the positive weights of the relevant pseudo-real representation, explaining why a half-hypermultiplet arises there. By altering the ordering of the singularities blown up in the process, we obtain, for both $SO(12)\rightarrow E_7$ and $E_7\rightarrow E_8$, the intersection diagram on every other row of the corresponding box graphs. We present detailed derivations of the intersection diagrams of the exceptional fibers at the singularity enhanced points by examining how an exceptional curve is lifted up on the chart arising due to the subsequent blowing-up process. When the colliding brane approaches the stack of branes as $O(s^2)$, we obtain additional conifold singularity at the enhanced point, which completes the full Dynkin diagram of the enhanced group as was found previously.

"  In this paper we present a deep X-ray observation of the nearby M dwarf GJ 357 and use it to put constraints on the atmospheric evolution of its planet, GJ 357 b. We also analyse the systematic errors in the stellar parameters of GJ 357 in order to see how they affect the perceived planetary properties. We estimate the age of GJ 357 b by comparing the observed X-ray luminosity of its host star, derived from a recent {\em XMM-Newton} observation {($\log{L_{\rm x}}\,{\rm [erg/s]} = 25.73$), with $L_{\rm x} -$ age relations for M dwarfs. We find that GJ 357 presents one of the lowest X-ray activity levels ever measured for an M dwarf, and we put a lower limit on its age of $5$\,Gyr.} Using this age limit, we perform a backwards reconstruction of the original primordial atmospheric reservoir. Furthermore, by considering the systematic errors in the stellar parameters, we find a range of possible planetary masses, radii, and densities. From the backwards reconstruction of GJ 357 b's irradiation history we find that the upper limit of its initial primordial atmospheric mass is $\sim \rm 38M_{\oplus}$. An initial atmospheric reservoir significantly larger than this may have survived through the X-ray and ultraviolet irradiation history, hence being inconsistent with current observations that suggest a telluric composition. In spite of the unlikelihood of a currently existing primordial envelope, volcanism and outgassing may have contributed to a secondary atmosphere. Under this assumption, we present three different synthetic infrared spectra for GJ 357 b that one might expect, consisting of $100\%~\rm CO_{2}$, $100\%~\rm SO_{2}$, and $75\%~ \rm N_{2}$, $24\%~\rm CO_{2}$ and $1\%~\rm H_{2}O$.

"  This study suggests a new data-driven model for the prediction of geomagnetic storm. The model which is an instance of Brain Emotional Learning Inspired Models (BELIMs), is known as the Brain Emotional Learning-based Prediction Model (BELPM). BELPM consists of four main subsystems; the connection between these subsystems has been mimicked by the corresponding regions of the emotional system. The functions of these subsystems are explained using adaptive networks. The learning algorithm of BELPM is defined using the steepest descent (SD) and the least square estimator (LSE). BELPM is employed to predict geomagnetic storms using two geomagnetic indices, Auroral Electrojet (AE) Index and Disturbance Time (Dst) Index. To evaluate the performance of BELPM, the obtained results have been compared with ANFIS, WKNN and other instances of BELIMs. The results verify that BELPM has the capability to achieve a reasonable accuracy for both the short-term and the long-term geomagnetic storms prediction.

We also show that the failure of this Cantor-Bernstein-type statement for arbitrary matroid families is consistent relative to the axioms of set theory ZFC. ",mathematics
"  The morphology of the stagnated plasma resulting from Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF) is measured by imaging the self-emission x-rays coming from the multi-keV plasma. Equivalent diagnostic response can be generated by integrated radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (rad-MHD) simulations from programs such as HYDRA and GORGON. There have been only limited quantitative ways to compare the image morphology, that is the texture, of simulations and experiments. We have developed a metric of image morphology based on the Mallat Scattering Transformation (MST), a transformation that has proved to be effective at distinguishing textures, sounds, and written characters. This metric is designed, demonstrated, and refined by classifying ensembles (i.e., classes) of synthetic stagnation images, and by regressing an ensemble of synthetic stagnation images to the morphology (i.e., model) parameters used to generate the synthetic images. We use this metric to quantitatively compare simulations to experimental images, experimental images to each other, and to estimate the morphological parameters of the experimental images with uncertainty. This coordinate space has proved very adept at doing a sophisticated relative background subtraction in the MST space. This was needed to compare the experimental self emission images to the rad-MHD simulation images. ",physics

"  Pulsating thermal X-ray emission from millisecond pulsars can be used to obtain constraints on the neutron star equation of state, but to date only five such sources have been identified. Of these five millisecond pulsars, only two have well constrained neutron star masses, which improve the determination of the radius via modelling of the X-ray waveform. We aim to find other millisecond pulsars that already have well constrained mass and distance measurements that show pulsed thermal X-ray emission in order to obtain tight constraints on the neutron star equation of state. The millisecond pulsar PSR~J1909--3744 has an accurately determined mass, M = 1.54$\pm$0.03 M$_\odot$ (1 $\sigma$ error) and distance, D = 1.07$\pm$0.04 kpc. We analysed {\em XMM-Newton} data of this 2.95 ms pulsar to identify the nature of the X-ray emission. We show that the X-ray emission from PSR~J1909--3744 appears to be dominated by thermal emission from the polar cap. Only a single component model is required to fit the data. The black-body temperature of this emission is kT=0.26\ud{0.03}{0.02} keV and we find a 0.2--10 keV un-absorbed flux of 1.1 $\times$ 10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ or an un-absorbed luminosity of 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{30}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Thanks to the previously determined mass and distance constraints of the neutron star PSR~J1909--3744, and its predominantly thermal emission, deep observations of this object with future X-ray facilities should provide useful constraints on the neutron star equation of state.

Thus, the interaction with electromagnetic field near the boundary differs significantly in the full model and in the effective theory for the surface mode. ",high energy physics theory
"  Consider random polynomials of the form $G_n = \sum_{i=0}^n \xi_i p_i$, where the $\xi_i$ are i.i.d. non-degenerate complex random variables, and $\{p_i\}$ is a sequence of orthonormal polynomials with respect to a regular measure $\tau$ supported on a compact set $K$. We show that the normalized counting measure of the zeros of $G_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the equilibrium measure of $K$ if and only if $\mathbb E \log(1 + |\xi_0|) < \infty$. This generalizes the corresponding result of Ibragimov-Zaporozhets in the case when $p_i(z) = z^i$. We also show that the normalized counting measure of the zeros of $G_n$ converges weakly in probability to the equilibrium measure of $K$ if and only if $\mathbb P (|\xi_0| > e^n) = o(n^{-1})$.   Our proofs rely on results from small ball probability and exploit the structure of general orthogonal polynomials. Our methods also work for sequences of asymptotically minimal polynomials in $L^p(\tau)$, where $p \in (0, \infty]$. In particular, sequences of $L^p$-minimal polynomials and (normalized) Faber and Fekete polynomials fall into this class. ",mathematics
"  The work aims to stabilize the unstable index-1 descriptor systems by Riccati-based feedback stabilization via a modified form of Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA), which is a bi-tangential interpolation-based technique. In the basic IRKA, for the stable systems the Reduced Order Models (ROMs) can be found conveniently, but it is unsuitable for the unstable ones. In the proposed technique, the initial feedback is implemented within the construction of the projectors of the IRKA approach. The solution of the Riccati equation is estimated from the ROM achieved by IRKA and hence the low-rank feedback matrix is attained. Using the reverse projecting process, for the full model the optimal feedback matrix is retrieved from the low-rank feedback matrix. Finally, to validate the aptness and competency of the proposed technique it is applied to unstable index-1 descriptor systems. The comparison of the present work with two previous works is narrated. The simulation is done by numerical computation using MATLAB, and both the tabular method and graphical method are used as the supporting tools of comparative analysis. ",mathematics
"  The orbital period of the hot Jupiter WASP-4b appears to be decreasing at a rate of $-8.64 \pm 1.26$ msec/yr, based on transit-timing measurements spanning 12 years. Proposed explanations for the period change include tidal orbital decay, apsidal precession, and acceleration of the system along the line of sight. To investigate further, we performed new radial velocity measurements and speckle imaging of WASP-4. The radial-velocity data show that the system is accelerating towards the Sun at a rate of $-0.0422\pm 0.0028$ m/s/day. The associated Doppler effect should cause the apparent period to shrink at a rate of $-5.94 \pm 0.39$ msec/yr, comparable to the observed rate. Thus, the observed change in the transit period is mostly or entirely produced by the line-of-sight acceleration of the system. This acceleration is probably caused by a wide-orbiting companion of mass 10-300$\,M_{\rm Jup}$ and orbital distance 10-100$\,$AU, based on the magnitude of the radial-velocity trend and the non-detection of any companion in the speckle images. We expect that the orbital periods of 1 out of 3 hot Jupiters will change at rates similar to WASP-4b, based on the hot-Jupiter companion statistics of Knutson et al. (2014). Continued radial velocity monitoring of hot Jupiters is therefore essential to distinguish the effects of tidal orbital decay or apsidal precession from line-of-sight acceleration. ",astrophysics
"  In this study, we propose an effective numerical approach to analyse and control geometrically nonlinear responses for the functionally graded (FG) porous plates reinforced by graphene platelets (GPLs) integrated with piezoelectric layers. The basis idea is to use isogeometric analysis (IGA) based on the B\'ezier extraction and the $C^0$-type higher-order shear deformation theory ($C^0$-HSDT). By applying the B\'ezier extraction, the original Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) control meshes can be transformed into the B\'ezier elements which allow us to inherit the standard numerical procedure like the finite element method (FEM). The mechanical displacement field is approximated based on the $C^0$-HSDT whilst the electric potential is assumed to be a linear function through the thickness of each piezoelectric sublayer. The FG plate contains the internal pores and GPLs dispersed in the metal matrix either uniformly or non-uniformly according to various different patterns along the thickness of plate. In addition, to control dynamic responses, two piezoelectric layers are perfectly bonded on the top and bottom surfaces of the FG plate. The geometrically nonlinear equations are solved by the Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and the Newmark's time integration scheme. The influences of the porosity coefficients, weight fractions of GPLs as well as the external electrical voltage on the geometrically nonlinear behaviours of the plates with different porosity distributions and GPL dispersion patterns are evidently investigated through numerical examples. Then, a constant displacement and velocity feedback control approaches are adopted to active control the geometrically nonlinear static as well as the dynamic responses of the FG porous plates, where the effect of the structural damping is considered, based on a closed-loop control with piezoelectric sensors and actuators.

"  Machine learning algorithms have recently been used to predict students' performance in an introductory physics class. The prediction model classified students as those likely to receive an A or B or students likely to receive a grade of C, D, F or withdraw from the class. Early prediction could better allow the direction of educational interventions and the allocation of educational resources. However, the performance metrics used in that study become unreliable when used to classify whether a student would receive an A, B or C (the ABC outcome) or if they would receive a D, F or withdraw (W) from the class (the DFW outcome) because the outcome is substantially unbalanced with between 10\% to 20\% of the students receiving a D, F, or W. This work presents techniques to adjust the prediction models and alternate model performance metrics more appropriate for unbalanced outcome variables. These techniques were applied to three samples drawn from introductory mechanics classes at two institutions ($N=7184$, $1683$, and $926$). Applying the same methods as the earlier study produced a classifier that was very inaccurate, classifying only 16\% of the DFW cases correctly; tuning the model increased the DFW classification accuracy to 43\%. Using a combination of institutional and in-class data improved DFW accuracy to 53\% by the second week of class.

"  Instance object segmentation and tracking provide comprehensive quantification of objects across microscope videos. The recent single-stage pixel-embedding based deep learning approach has shown its superior performance compared with ""segment-then-associate"" two-stage solutions.

Our hybrid payment system employs quantum states as banknotes and a classical blockchain to settle disputes and to keep track of the valid serial numbers. It has several desirable properties: it is decentralized, requiring no trust in any single entity; payments are as quick as quantum communication, regardless of the total number of users; when a quantum banknote is damaged or lost, the rightful owner can recover the lost value.

"  Recently it was proposed that the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation reflects the information of a region including the interior of the event horizon, which is called as ""island."" This also implies that the information of the complement of the Hawking radiation, which is nothing but the black hole, is not placed inside the event horizon, at least after the Page time. We study the entanglement entropy of the black hole as the complement of the Hawking radiation, in the eternal Schwarzschild black hole in the four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. Although the entanglement entropy of the black hole before the Page time is given by that of a region including the interior of the event horizon, it can be interpreted as a consequence of the replica trick in gravitational theories, in a similar fashion to the island for the Hawking radiation. By comparing it with the maximally extended island, the information of the black hole is considered to be localized on a surface near the event horizon, which would be interpreted as the stretched horizon. This structure also resembles black holes in the AdS spacetime with an auxiliary flat spacetime, where the information of the black hole is localized at the interface between the AdS spacetime and the flat spacetime.

"  Shelter-in-place and lockdowns have been some of the main non-pharmaceutical interventions that governments around the globe have implemented to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper we study the impact of such interventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that exhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is that we use granular geo-located cell-phone data to measure shelter-at-home behavior as well as trips within the city, thereby allowing to capture the adherence to lockdowns. Using panel data linear regression models we first show that a 10\% reduction in mobility implies a 13-26\% reduction in infections. However, the impact of social distancing measures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on socioeconomic level. While high income zones can exhibit reductions in mobility of around 60-80\% (significantly driven by voluntary lockdowns), lower income zones only reduce mobility by 20-40\%. Our results show that failing to acknowledge the heterogenous effect of shelter-in-place behavior even within a city can have dramatic consequences in the contention of the pandemic. It also confirms the challenges of implementing mandatory lockdowns in lower-income communities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be effective, lockdowns in counties of low socioeconomic levels may need to be complemented with other measures that support their inhabitants, providing aid to increase compliance. ",physics

"  The magnetization $|\Omega_{\mathrm e}|/\omega_{\mathrm{e}}$ is an important parameter in plasma astrophysics, where $\Omega_{\mathrm e}$ and $\omega_{\mathrm{e}}$ are the electron gyro-frequency and electron plasma frequency, respectively. It only depends on the mass ratio $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and the light-to-Alfv\'en speed ratio $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$, where $m_{\mathrm i}$ ($m_{\mathrm e}$) is the ion (electron) mass, $c$ is the speed of light, and $v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ is the ion Alfv\'en speed. Nonlinear numerical plasma models such as particle-in-cell simulations must often assume unrealistic values for $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and for $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$. Because linear theory yields exact results for parametric scalings of wave properties at small amplitudes, we use linear theory to investigate the dispersion relations of Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron and fast-magnetosonic/whistler waves as prime examples for collective plasma behaviour depending on $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$. We analyse their dependence on $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ and $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ in quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular directions of propagation with respect to the background magnetic field for a plasma with $\beta_j\sim1$, where $\beta_j$ is the ratio of the thermal to magnetic pressure for species $j$. Although their dispersion relations are largely independent of $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}$ for $c/v_{\mathrm{Ai}}\gtrsim 10$, the mass ratio $m_{\mathrm i}/m_{\mathrm e}$ has a strong effect at scales smaller than the ion inertial length. Moreover, we study the impact of relativistic electron effects on the dispersion relations.

The algorithm is a two-timescale method that uses a variant of Q-learning on the finer timescale to perform policy evaluation while exploring the policy space on the coarser timescale. Agents following this algorithm are ""independent learners"": they use only local controls, local cost realizations, and global state information, without access to controls of other agents. The results presented here are the first, to our knowledge, to give formal guarantees of convergence to team optimality using independent learners in stochastic dynamic teams and common interest games.

"  The fast growth of communication technology within the concept of smart grids can provide data and control signals from/to all consumers in an online fashion. This could foster more participation for end-user customers. These types of customers do not necessarily have powerful prediction tools or capability of storing a large amount of historical data. Besides, the relevant information is not always known a priori, while decisions need to be made fast within a very limited time. These limitations and also the novel structure of decision making, which comes from the necessities to make the decision very fast with a limited amount of information, implies a requirement for investigating a novel framework: online decision-making. In this study, we propose an online constrained convex optimization framework for operating responsive end-user electrical customers in real-time. Within this online-decision-making framework, algorithms are proposed for two cases: no prediction data is available at the moment of decision-making, and a limited number of forward time periods predictions of uncertain parameters are available. The simulation results exhibit the capability of the model to achieve considerable profits in an easy-to-implement procedure. Comprehensive numerical test cases are performed for comparison with existent alternative models. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  CDT is an attempt to formulate a non-perturbative lattice theory of quantum gravity. We describe the phase diagram and analyse the phase transition between phase B and phase C (which is the analogue of the de Sitter phase observed for the spherical spatial topology). This transition is accessible to ordinary Monte Carlo simulations when the topology of space is toroidal. We find that the transition is most likely first order, but with unusual properties. The end points of the transition line are candidates for second order phase transition points where an UV continuum limit might exist. ",high energy physics theory
"  The intermediate mass Herbig Ae star V1787 Ori is a member of the L1641 star-forming region in the Orion A molecular cloud. We report the detection of an M-type companion to V1787 Ori at a projected separation of 6.66"" (corresponding to 2577 au), from the analysis of VLT/NACO adaptive optics $K_s$-band image. Using astrometric data from Gaia DR2, we show that V1787 Ori A and B share similar distance ($d$ $\sim$ 387 pc) and proper motion, indicating that they are physically associated. We estimate the spectral type of V1787 Ori B to be M5 $\pm$ 2 from color--spectral type calibration tables and template matching using SpeX spectral library. By fitting PARSEC models in the Pan-STARRS color-magnitude diagram, we find that V1787 Ori B has an age of 8.1$^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ Myr and a mass of 0.39$^{+0.02}_{-0.05}$ $M_\odot$. We show that V1787 Ori is a pre-main sequence wide binary system with a mass ratio of 0.23. Such a low mass ratio system is rarely identified in Herbig Ae/Be binary systems. We conclude this work with a discussion on possible mechanisms for the formation of V1787 Ori wide binary system. ",astrophysics
"  Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality worldwide. Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in the asymptomatic stage can help prevent strokes. It also improves clinical decision making through the delivery of suitable treatment such as, anticoagulant therapy, in a timely manner. The clinical significance of such early detection of AF in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has inspired numerous studies in recent years, of which many aim to solve this task by leveraging machine learning algorithms. ECG datasets containing AF samples, however, usually suffer from severe class imbalance, which if unaccounted for, affects the performance of classification algorithms. Data augmentation is a popular solution to tackle this problem.   In this study, we investigate the impact of various data augmentation algorithms, e.g., oversampling, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), on solving the class imbalance problem. These algorithms are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated, compared and discussed in detail. The results show that deep learning-based AF signal classification methods benefit more from data augmentation using GANs and GMMs, than oversampling. Furthermore, the GAN results in circa $3\%$ better AF classification accuracy in average while performing comparably to the GMM in terms of f1-score. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Minkowski functionals (MFs) quantify the topological properties of a given field probing its departure from Gaussianity. We investigate their use on lensing convergence maps in order to see whether they can provide further insights on the underlying cosmology with respect to the standard second-order statistics, i.e., cosmic shear tomography. To this end, we first present a method to match theoretical predictions with measured MFs taking care of the shape noise, imperfections in the map reconstruction, and inaccurate description of the nonlinearities in the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We validate this method against simulated maps reconstructed from shear fields generated by the MICE simulation. We then perform a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the accuracy on cosmological parameters from a joint MFs and shear tomography analysis. It turns out that MFs are indeed helpful to break the $\Omega_{\rm m}$--$\sigma_8$ degeneracy thus generating a sort of chain reaction leading to an overall increase of the Figure of Merit.

"  Protoplanetary discs (PPDs) in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) are irradiated by UV fields from the massive star $\theta^1$C. This drives thermal winds, inducing mass loss rates of up to $\dot{M}_\mathrm{wind}\sim 10^{-7}\,M_\odot$/yr in the `proplyds' (ionised PPDs) close to the centre. For the mean age of the ONC and reasonable initial PPD masses, such mass loss rates imply that discs should have been dispersed. However, ~80% of stars still exhibit a NIR excess, suggesting that significant circumstellar mass remains. This `proplyd lifetime problem' has persisted since the discovery of photoevaporating discs in the core of the ONC by O'Dell & Wen (1994). In this work, we demonstrate how an extended period of star formation can solve this problem. Coupling N-body calculations and a viscous disc evolution model, we obtain high disc fractions at the present day. This is partly due to the migration of older stars outwards, and younger stars inwards such that the most strongly irradiated PPDs are also the youngest. We show how the disc mass distribution can be used to test the recent claims in the literature for multiple stellar populations in the ONC. Our model also explains the recent finding that host mass and PPD mass are only weakly correlated, in contrast with other regions of similar age. We conclude that the status of the ONC as the archetype for understanding the influence of environment on planet formation is undeserved; the complex star formation history (involving star formation episodes within ~0.8 Myr of the present day) results in confusing signatures in the PPD population.

"  We present a complete set of structural parameters for a sample of 99 intermediate-age Super Star Cluster (SSCs) in the disk of M82, and carry out a survival analysis using the semi-analytical cluster evolution code EMACSS. The parameters are based on the profile-fitting analysis carried out in a previous work, with the mass-related quantities derived using a mass-to-light ratio for a constant age of 100 Myr. The SSCs follow a power-law mass function with an index ${\alpha}$=1.5, and a log-normal size function with a typical half-light radius, Rh=4.3 pc, which are both comparable with the values for clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, rather than in giant spirals. The majority of the SSCs follow a power-law mass-radius relation with an index of b=0.29${\pm}$0.05. A dynamical analysis of M82 SSCs using EMACSS suggests that 23% of the clusters are tidally-limited, with the rest undergoing expansion at present. Forward evolution of these clusters suggests that the majority would dissolve in ~2 Gyr. However, a group of four massive compact clusters, and another group of five SSCs at relatively large galactocentric distances, are found to survive for a Hubble time. The model-predicted mass, Rh, ${\mu_V}$ and core radius of these surviving SSCs at 12 Gyr are comparable with the corresponding values for the sample of Galactic globular clusters. ",astrophysics
"  In numerous realizations of complex plasmas, dust-dust interactions are characterized by two screening lengths and are thus better described by a combination of Yukawa potentials. The present work investigates the static correlations and the thermodynamics of repulsive dense bi-Yukawa fluids based on the fact that such strongly coupled systems exhibit isomorph invariance. The strong virial-potential energy correlations are demonstrated with the aid of molecular dynamics simulations, an accurate analytical expression for the isomorph family of curves is obtained and an empirical expression for the fluid-solid phase-coexistence line is proposed. The isomorph-based empirically modified hypernetted-chain approach, grounded on the ansatz of isomorph invariant bridge functions, is then extended to such systems and the resulting structural properties show an excellent agreement with the results of computer simulations. A simple and accurate closed-form expression is obtained for the excess internal energy of dense bi-Yukawa fluids by capitalizing on the compact parameterization offered by the Rosenfeld-Tarazona decomposition in combination with the Rosenfeld scaling, which opens up the energy route to thermodynamics.

"  We study aspects of anti-de Sitter space in the context of the Swampland. In particular, we conjecture that the near-flat limit of pure AdS belongs to the Swampland, as it is necessarily accompanied by an infinite tower of light states. The mass of the tower is power-law in the cosmological constant, with a power of $\frac{1}{2}$ for the supersymmetric case. We discuss relations between this behaviour and other Swampland conjectures such as the censorship of an unbounded number of massless fields, and the refined de Sitter conjecture. Moreover, we propose that changes to the AdS radius have an interpretation in terms of a generalised distance conjecture which associates a distance to variations of all fields. In this framework, we argue that the distance to the $\Lambda \rightarrow 0$ limit of AdS is infinite, leading to the light tower of states. We also discuss implications of the conjecture for de Sitter space. ",high energy physics theory
"  Let ${\mathcal O}$ be the ring of $S$-integers in a number field $K$. For $A\in\rm{SL}_{2}(\mathcal{O})$ and $k\geq 1$, we define matrix-factorization varieties $V_k(A)$ over ${\mathcal O}$ which parametrize factoring $A$ into a product of $k$ elementary matrices; the equations defining $V_k(A)$ are written in terms of Euler's continuant polynomials. We show that the $V_k(A)$ are rational $(k-3)$-folds with an inductive fibration structure. We combine this geometric structure with arithmetic results to study the Zariski closure of the ${\mathcal O}$-points of $V_k(A)$. We prove that for $k\geq 4$ the ${\mathcal O}$-points on $V_k(A)$ are Zariski dense if $V_{k}(A)({\mathcal O})\neq\emptyset$ assuming the group of units ${\mathcal O}^{\times}$ is infinite. This shows that if $A$ can be written as a product of $k\geq 4$ elementary matrices, then this can be done in infinitely many ways in the strongest sense possible. This can then be combined with results on factoring into elementary matrices for ${\rm SL}_{2}({\mathcal O})$. One result is that for $k\geq 9$ the ${\mathcal O}$-points on $V_{k}(A)$ are Zariski dense if ${\mathcal O}^{\times}$ is infinite. ",mathematics
"  We demonstrate time-resolved nonlinear extreme-ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy on multiply charged ions, here applied to the doubly charged neon ion, driven by a phase-locked sequence of two intense free-electron laser pulses.

"  The Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detectors (MPGD) have been widely adopted in nuclear and particle physics experiments, for their fast response and other excellent characteristics. To achieve the required signal strength and detection efficiency, sometimes they are operated at a high voltage range. This often challenges the limit of high voltage stability of the detector. Discharge in gaseous detectors is a complex process and involves several responsible factors. The microscopic geometrical structures of the MPGDs may itself sometimes induce discharges.   In this study, we are numerically investigating the discharge phenomena in non-resistive Micromegas. Within the COMSOL framework, a 3-dimensional model is developed to observe the occurrence and the development of discharge in Micromegas. The effect of space charge has been taken into account in the calculation. The model allows to vary the geometrical parameters of the detector as well as to study the effects of gas impurities and a different number of primary charges. ",physics
"  Advection-dominated dynamical systems, characterized by partial differential equations, are found in applications ranging from weather forecasting to engineering design where accuracy and robustness are crucial. There has been significant interest in the use of techniques borrowed from machine learning to reduce the computational expense and/or improve the accuracy of predictions for these systems. These rely on the identification of a basis that reduces the dimensionality of the problem and the subsequent use of time series and sequential learning methods to forecast the evolution of the reduced state. Often, however, machine-learned predictions after reduced-basis projection are plagued by issues of stability stemming from incomplete capture of multiscale processes as well as due to error growth for long forecast durations. To address these issues, we have developed a \emph{non-autoregressive} time series approach for predicting linear reduced-basis time histories of forward models. In particular, we demonstrate that non-autoregressive counterparts of sequential learning methods such as long short-term memory (LSTM) considerably improve the stability of machine-learned reduced-order models. We evaluate our approach on the inviscid shallow water equations and show that a non-autoregressive variant of the standard LSTM approach that is bidirectional in the PCA components obtains the best accuracy for recreating the nonlinear dynamics of partial observations. Moreover---and critical for many applications of these surrogates---inference times are reduced by three orders of magnitude using our approach, compared with both the equation-based Galerkin projection method and the standard LSTM approach.

"  The isogeometric approximation of the Stokes problem in a trimmed domain is studied. This setting is characterized by an underlying mesh unfitted with the boundary of the physical domain making the imposition of the essential boundary conditions a challenging problem. A very popular strategy is to rely on the so-called Nitsche method [22]. We show with numerically examples that in some degenerate trimmed domain configurations there is a lack of stability of the formulation, potentially polluting the computed solutions. After extending the stabilization procedure of [17] to incompressible flow problems, we theoretically prove that, combined with the Raviart-Thomas isogeometric element, we are able to recover the well-posedness of the formulation and, consequently, optimal a priori error estimates. Numerical results corroborating the theory and extending it for the case of the isogeometric N\'ed\'elec and Taylor-Hood elements are provided. ",mathematics

This is the first in a series of papers in which we address this challenge, following and extending our short announcement in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 021602]. According to Dolan and Osborn, conformal blocks can be determined from the set of differential eigenvalue equations that they satisfy. We construct a complete set of commuting differential operators that characterize multipoint conformal blocks for any number $N$ of points in any dimension and for any choice of OPE channel through the relation with Gaudin integrable models we uncovered in [Phys.

As an application, we study the geometry of rank two meromorphic rank two $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Poisson modules which can be interpreted as a Poisson analogous to transversally projective structures for codimension one holomorphic foliations. Moreover, we describe the geometry of the symplectic foliation induced by the Poisson connection on the projectivization of the Poisson module. ",mathematics
"  Automation of cranes can have a direct impact on the productivity of construction projects. In this paper, we focus on the control of one of the most used cranes, the boom crane. Tower cranes and overhead cranes have been widely studied in the literature, whereas the control of boom cranes has been investigated only by a few works. Typically, these works make use of simple models making use of a large number of simplifying assumptions (e.g. fixed length cable, assuming certain dynamics are uncoupled, etc.) A first result of this paper is to present a fairly complete nonlinear dynamic model of a boom crane taking into account all coupling dynamics and where the only simplifying assumption is that the cable is considered as rigid. The boom crane involves pitching and rotational movements, which generate complicated centrifugal forces, and consequently, equations of motion highly nonlinear. On the basis of this model, a control law has been developed able to perform position control of the crane while actively damping the oscillations of the load. The effectiveness of the approach has been tested in simulation with realistic physical parameters and tested in the presence of wind disturbances. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Although this issue has been addressed by us and others previously, our emphasis in this article is to resolve any ambiguity regarding the correct form of the gauge boson propagator to be used in the light-front gauge. We show how integrating over the light-front energy consistently in the covariant expression of each of the three one loop corrections leads to the propagating as well as the instantaneous diagrams of the light-front theory. In doing so, we re-establish the necessity of using the doubly transverse gauge boson propagator. ",high energy physics theory

"  We discuss some general aspects of commutators of local operators in Lorentzian CFTs, which can be obtained from a suitable analytic continuation of the Euclidean operator product expansion (OPE). Commutators only make sense as distributions, and care has to be taken to extract the right distribution from the OPE. We provide explicit computations in two and four-dimensional CFTs, focusing mainly on commutators of components of the stress-tensor. We rederive several familiar results, such as the canonical commutation relations of free field theory, the local form of the Poincar\'e algebra, and the Virasoro algebra of two-dimensional CFT. We then consider commutators of light-ray operators built from the stress-tensor. Using simplifying features of the light sheet limit in four-dimensional CFT we provide a direct computation of the BMS algebra formed by a specific set of light-ray operators. In four-dimensional CFT we define a new infinite set of light-ray operators constructed from the stress-tensor, which all have well-defined matrix elements. These are a direct generalization of the two-dimensional Virasoro light-ray operators that are obtained from a conformal embedding of Minkowski space in the Lorentzian cylinder. They obey Hermiticity conditions similar to their two-dimensional analogues, and also share the property that a semi-infinite subset annihilates the vacuum. ",high energy physics theory
"  We use an Autoregressive (AR) approach combined with a Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to estimate radial surface currents from coastal High-Frequency Radar (HFR) complex voltage time series. The performances of this combined AR-MEM model are investigated with synthetic HFR data and compared with the classical Doppler spectrum approach. It is shown that AR-MEM drastically improves the quality and the rate of success of the surface current estimation for short integration time. To confirm these numerical results, the same analysis is conducted with an experimental data set acquired with a 16.3 MHz HFR in Toulon. It is found that the AR-MEM technique is able to provide high-quality and high-coverage maps of surface currents even with very short integration time (about 1 minute) where the classical spectral approach can only fulfill the quality tests on a sparse coverage. Further useful application of the technique is found in the tracking of surface current at high-temporal resolution. Rapid variations of the surface current at the time scale of the minute are unveiled and shown consistent with a $f^{-5/3}$ decay of turbulent spectra. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  We study the stratified gas in a rapidly rotating centrifuge as a model for the Earth's atmosphere. Based on methods of perturbation theory, it is shown that in certain regimes, internal waves in the gas centrifuge have the same dispersion relation to leading order as their atmospheric siblings. Assuming an air filled centrifuge with a radius of circa 50 cm, the optimal rotational frequency for realistic atmosphere-like waves, that encounter anelastic amplification, is around 10000 rounds per minute. Using gases of lower heat capacities at constant pressure, like Argon and Xenon, the rotational frequencies can be even halved to obtain the same results. Similar to the atmosphere, it is feasible in the gas centrifuge to generate a clear scale separation of wave frequencies and therefore phase speeds between acoustic waves and internal waves. In addition to the centrifugal force, the Coriolis force acts in the same plane. However, its influence on the internal waves appears only as a higher-order correction. We conclude that the gas centrifuge provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate atmospheric internal waves experimentally with a compressible working fluid. ",physics

"  We describe the dynamics of two-dimensional relativistic and Carrollian fluids.

This requires to handle the conformal anomaly, and the expressions obtained for the reconstructed bulk metrics incorporate non-conformal-fluid data. We also analyze the freedom of choosing arbitrarily the hydrodynamic frame for the description of relativistic fluids, and propose an invariant entropy current compatible with classical and extended irreversible thermodynamics. This local freedom breaks down in the dual gravitational picture, and fluid/gravity correspondence turns out to be sensitive to dissipation processes: the fluid heat current is a necessary ingredient for reconstructing all Banados asymptotically anti-de Sitter solutions. The same feature emerges for Carrollian fluids, which enjoy a residual frame invariance, and their Barnich-Troessaert locally Minkowski duals. These statements are proven by computing the algebra of surface conserved charges in the fluid-reconstructed bulk three-dimensional spacetimes. ",high energy physics theory

"  This paper documents a simple parametric polynomial line-of-sight channel model for 100-450 GHz band. The band comprises two popular beyond fifth generation (B5G) frequency bands, namely, the D band (110-170 GHz) and the low-THz band (around 275-325 GHz). The main focus herein is to derive a simple, compact, and accurate molecular absorption loss model for the 100-450 GHz band. The derived model relies on simple absorption line shape functions that are fitted to the actual response given by complex but exact database approach. The model is also reducible for particular sub-bands within the full range of 100-450 GHz, further simplifying the absorption loss estimate. The proposed model is shown to be very accurate by benchmarking it against the exact response and the similar models given by International Telecommunication Union Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R). The loss is shown to be within $\pm$2 dBs from the exact response for one kilometer link in highly humid environment. Therefore, the its accuracy is even much better in the case of usually considered shorter range future B5G wireless systems. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Major mergers of gas-rich galaxies provide promising conditions for the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $\gtrsim10^5$ M$_\odot$) by direct collapse because they can trigger mass inflows as high as $10^4-10^5$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ on sub-parsec scales. However, the channel of SMBH formation in this case, either dark collapse (direct collapse without prior stellar phase) or supermassive star (SMS; $\gtrsim10^4$ M$_\odot$), remains unknown. Here, we investigate the limit in accretion rate up to which stars can maintain hydrostatic equilibrium. We compute hydrostatic models of SMSs accreting at $1-1000$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and estimate the departures from equilibrium a posteriori by taking into account the finite speed of sound. We find that stars accreting above the atomic cooling limit ($\gtrsim10$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) can only maintain hydrostatic equilibrium once they are supermassive. In this case, they evolve adiabatically with a hylotropic structure, that is, entropy is locally conserved and scales with the square root of the mass coordinate. Our results imply that stars can only become supermassive by accretion at the rates of atomically cooled haloes ($\sim0.1-10$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). Once they are supermassive, larger rates are possible. ",astrophysics

"  In the standard cosmology, it is believed that there are two weak and distinct band-limited absorption features, near 20 MHz ($z\sim70$) and 90 MHz ($z\sim15$) in the global cosmological 21 cm signal which are signatures of collisional gas dynamics in the cosmic dark ages and Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from the first stars at cosmic dawn, respectively. A similar prediction of two distinct band-limited, but stronger, absorption features is expected in models with excess gas cooling, which have been invoked to explain the anomalous EDGES signal. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism, where dark matter spin-flip interactions with electrons through a light axial-vector mediator could directly induce a 21 cm signal which is characteristically different from either of these. We find generically, that our model predicts a strong, broadband absorption signal extending from frequencies as low as 1.4 MHz ($z\sim1000$), from early in the cosmic dark ages where no conventional signal is expected, all the way up to 90 MHz, depending upon the epoch of star formation and X-ray heating. We find a rich set of spectral features that could be probed in current and future experiments looking for the global 21 cm signal. In standard cosmology and in excess gas cooling models the gas spin temperature as inferred from the absorption signal is a tracer of the gas kinetic temperature. However, in our model we find in certain regions of parameter space that the spin temperature and kinetic temperature of the gas evolve differently, and the absorption signal only measures the spin temperature evolution. Large swathes of our model parameter space of interest are safe from existing particle physics constraints, however future searches for short range spin-dependent forces between electrons on the millimeter to nanometer scale have the potential to discover the light mediator responsible for our predicted signal.

"  We study the distributed average consensus problem in multi-agent systems with directed communication links that are subject to quantized information flow. The goal of distributed average consensus is for the nodes, each associated with some initial value, to obtain the average (or some value close to the average) of these initial values. In this paper, we present and analyze a distributed averaging algorithm which operates exclusively with quantized values (specifically, the information stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring agents is subject to deterministic uniform quantization) and rely on event-driven updates (e.g., to reduce energy consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). We characterize the properties of the proposed distributed averaging protocol, illustrate its operation with an example, and show that its execution, on any timeinvariant and strongly connected digraph, will allow all agents to reach, in finite time, a common consensus value that is equal to the quantized average. We conclude with comparisons against existing quantized average consensus algorithms that illustrate the performance and potential advantages of the proposed algorithm.

"  Intervertebral discs (IVDs), as small joints lying between adjacent vertebrae, have played an important role in pressure buffering and tissue protection. The fully-automatic localization and segmentation of IVDs have been discussed in the literature for many years since they are crucial to spine disease diagnosis and provide quantitative parameters in the treatment. Traditionally hand-crafted features are derived based on image intensities and shape priors to localize and segment IVDs. With the advance of deep learning, various neural network models have gained great success in image analysis including the recognition of intervertebral discs. Particularly, U-Net stands out among other approaches due to its outstanding performance on biomedical images with a relatively small set of training data. This paper proposes a novel convolutional framework based on 3D U-Net to segment IVDs from multi-modality MRI images. We first localize the centers of intervertebral discs in each spine sample and then train the network based on the cropped small volumes centered at the localized intervertebral discs. A detailed comprehensive analysis of the results using various combinations of multi-modalities is presented. Furthermore, experiments conducted on 2D and 3D U-Nets with augmented and non-augmented datasets are demonstrated and compared in terms of Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. Our method has proved to be effective with a mean segmentation Dice coefficient of 89.0% and a standard deviation of 1.4%. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  In [Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 250401 (2015)] the sharing of non-locality by multiple observers was demonstrated through the quantum violation of Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Halt inequality. In this paper we provide a scheme for sharing of non-locality and non-trivial preparation contextuality sequentially through the quantum violation of a family of Bell's inequalities where Alice and Bob perform $2^{n-1}$ and $n$ numbers of measurements of dichotomic observables respectively. For this, we consider that Alice always performs projective measurement and multiple Bobs sequentially perform unsharp measurement. We show that when Bob's choices of measurement settings are unbiased, maximum two Bobs can sequentially share the non-locality through the violation of our inequalities. Further, we show that the local bound of the aforementioned family of inequalities gets reduced if non-trivial preparation non-contextuality assumptions are further imposed. Then there is a chance to share the non-trivial preparation contextuality for more number of Bobs than that of non-locality. We demonstrate that the non-trivial preparation contextuality can be sequentially shared by arbitrary numbers of Bob for unbiased choices of his measurement settings. ",quantum physics
"  We introduce a combined molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum trajectories (QT) code to simulate the effects of near-resonant optical fields on state-vector evolution and particle motion in a collisional system. In contrast to collisionless systems, in which the quantum dynamics of multi-level, laser-driven particles with spontaneous emission can be described with the optical Bloch equations (OBEs), particle velocities in sufficiently collisional systems change on timescales comparable to those of the laser-induced, quantum-state dynamics. These transient velocity changes can cause the time-averaged velocity dependence of the quantum state to differ from the OBE solution. We use this multiscale code to describe laser-cooling in a strontium ultracold neutral plasma. Important phenomena described by the simulation include suppression of electromagnetically induced transparencies through rapid velocity changing collisions and thermalization between cooled and un-cooled directions for anisotropic laser cooling.

"  In recent years, deep learning (DL) has contributed significantly to the improvement of motor-imagery brain-machine interfaces (MI-BMIs) based on electroencephalography(EEG). While achieving high classification accuracy, DL models have also grown in size, requiring a vast amount of memory and computational resources. This poses a major challenge to an embedded BMI solution that guarantees user privacy, reduced latency, and low power consumption by processing the data locally. In this paper, we propose EEG-TCNet, a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves outstanding accuracy while requiring few trainable parameters. Its low memory footprint and low computational complexity for inference make it suitable for embedded classification on resource-limited devices at the edge. Experimental results on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset show that EEG-TCNet achieves 77.35% classification accuracy in 4-class MI. By finding the optimal network hyperparameters per subject, we further improve the accuracy to 83.84%. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of EEG-TCNet on the Mother of All BCI Benchmarks (MOABB), a large scale test benchmark containing 12 different EEG datasets with MI experiments. The results indicate that EEG-TCNet successfully generalizes beyond one single dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art (SoA) on MOABB by a meta-effect of 0.25.

"  Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely used diagnostic tool to monitor the condition of the cardiovascular system. Deep neural networks (DNNs), have been developed in many research labs for automatic interpretation of ECG signals to identify potential abnormalities in patient hearts. Studies have shown that given a sufficiently large amount of data, the classification accuracy of DNNs could reach human-expert cardiologist level. A DNN-based automated ECG diagnostic system would be an affordable solution for patients in developing countries where human-expert cardiologist are lacking. However, despite of the excellent performance in classification accuracy, it has been shown that DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks: subtle changes in input of a DNN can lead to a wrong classification output with high confidence. Thus, it is challenging and essential to improve adversarial robustness of DNNs for ECG signal classification, a life-critical application. In this work, we proposed to improve DNN robustness from the perspective of noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) and developed two methods to minimize NSR during training process. We evaluated the proposed methods on PhysionNets MIT-BIH dataset, and the results show that our proposed methods lead to an enhancement in robustness against PGD adversarial attack and SPSA attack, with a minimal change in accuracy on clean data.

"  We summarize the results of a dedicated effort between 2012 and 2019 to follow the evolution of the cyclotron line in Her~X-1 through repeated NuSTAR observations. The previously observed nearly 20-year long decay of the cyclotron line energy has ended around 2012: from there onward the pulse phase averaged flux corrected cyclotron line energy has remained stable and constant at an average value of Ecyc= (37.44+/-0.07) keV (normalized to a flux level of 6.8 RXTE/ASM-cts/s). The flux dependence of Ecyc discovered in 2007 is now measured with high precision, giving a slope of (0.675+/-0.075) keV/(ASM-cts/s), corresponding to an increase of 6.5% of Ecyc for an increase in flux by a factor of two. We also find that all line parameters as well as the continuum parameters show a correlation with X-ray flux. While a correlation between Ecyc and X-ray flux (both positive and negative) is now known for several accreting binaries with various suggestions for the underlying physics, the phenomenon of a long-term decay has so far only been seen in Her~X-1 and Vela~X-1, with far less convincing explanations.

"  We revise the cosmological bounds on Ho\v{r}ava gravity taking into accounts the stringent constraint on the speed of propagation of gravitational waves from GW170817 and GRB170817A. In light of this we also investigate the degeneracy between massive neutrinos and Ho\v{r}ava gravity. We show that a luminal propagation of gravitational waves suppresses the large-scale Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation temperature anisotropies and the presence of massive neutrinos increases this effect. On the contrary large neutrinos mass can compensate the modifications induced by Ho\v{r}ava gravity in the lensing, matter and primordial B-mode power spectra. Another degeneracy is found, at theoretical level, between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and massive neutrinos as well as with the model's parameters. We analyze these effects using CMB, supernovae type Ia (SNIa), galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing measurements and we show how such degeneracies are removed. We find that the model's parameters are constrained to be very close to their General Relativity limits and we get a two order of magnitude improved upper bound, with respect to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraint, on the deviation of the effective gravitational constant from the Newtonian one. The deviance information criterion suggests that in Ho\v{r}ava gravity $\Sigma m_\nu>0$ is favored when CMB data only are considered, while the joint analysis of all datasets prefers zero neutrinos mass.

We then discuss the ways in which particles can be accelerated to high energies in magnetised plasmas, focusing mainly on shock acceleration, second-order Fermi and magnetic reconnection; in the process, we attempt to shed some light on the basic conditions that must be met by any mechanism for the various observational constraints to be satisfied. We describe the limiting factors for the maximum particle energy and briefly discuss multimessenger signals from neutrinos and ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, before describing the journey of jet plasma from jet launch to cocoon with reference to the different acceleration mechanisms.

"  We propose a new approach to the theory of conditioning for numerical analysis problems for which both classical and stochastic perturbation theory fail to predict the observed accuracy of computed solutions. To motivate our ideas, we present examples of problems that are discontinuous at a given input and have infinite classical and stochastic condition number, but where the solution is still computed to machine precision without relying on structured algorithms. Stimulated by the failure of classical and stochastic perturbation theory in capturing such phenomena, we define and analyse a weak worst-case and a weak stochastic condition number. This new theory is a more powerful predictor of the accuracy of computations than existing tools, especially when the worst-case and the expected sensitivity of a problem to perturbations of the input is not finite. We apply our analysis to the computation of simple eigenvalues of matrix polynomials, including the more difficult case of singular matrix polynomials. In addition, we show how the weak condition numbers can be estimated in practice. ",mathematics
"  Decentralized coordination of a robot swarm requires addressing the tension between local perceptions and actions, and the accomplishment of a global objective. In this work, we propose to learn decentralized controllers based on solely raw visual inputs. For the first time, that integrates the learning of two key components: communication and visual perception, in one end-to-end framework. More specifically, we consider that each robot has access to a visual perception of the immediate surroundings, and communication capabilities to transmit and receive messages from other neighboring robots. Our proposed learning framework combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for each robot to extract messages from the visual inputs, and a graph neural network (GNN) over the entire swarm to transmit, receive and process these messages in order to decide on actions. The use of a GNN and locally-run CNNs results naturally in a decentralized controller. We jointly train the CNNs and the GNN so that each robot learns to extract messages from the images that are adequate for the team as a whole. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed architecture in the problem of drone flocking and show its promising performance and scalability, e.g., achieving successful decentralized flocking for large-sized swarms consisting of up to 75 drones.

"  Radio interferometer arrays with non-homogeneous element patterns are more difficult to calibrate compared to the more common homogeneous array. In particular, the non-homogeneity of the patterns has significant implications on the computational tractability of evaluating the calibration solutions. We apply the A-stacking technique to this problem and explore the trade-off to be made between the calibration accuracy and computational complexity. Through simulations, we show that this technique can be favourably applied in the context of an SKA-Low station. We show that the minimum accuracy requirements can be met at a significantly reduced computational cost, and this cost can be reduced even further if the station calibration timescale is relaxed from 10 minutes to several hours. We demonstrate the impact antenna designs with differing levels of non-homogeneity have on the overall computational complexity in addition to some cases where calibration performs poorly.

The black holes can have finite angular momentum and an arbitrary charge-to-mass ratio, unlike their supersymmetric cousins.

Thus, they provide interesting prototypes to study deviations from Kerr solutions caused by new horizon-scale physics. In this paper, we compute the gravitational multipole structure of these solutions and compare them to Kerr black holes. The multipoles of the black hole differ significantly from Kerr as they depend non-trivially on the charge-to-mass ratio. The horizonless microstate geometries have the same multipoles as their corresponding black hole, with small deviations set by the scale of their microstructure. ",high energy physics theory
"  A planar laser pulse propagating in vacuum can exhibit an extremely large ponderomotive force. This force, however, cannot impart net energy to an electron: As the pulse overtakes the electron, the initial impulse from its rising edge is completely undone by an equal and opposite impulse from its trailing edge. Here we show that planar-like ""flying focus"" pulses can break this symmetry, imparting relativistic energies to electrons. The intensity peak of a flying focus-a moving focal point resulting from a chirped laser pulse focused by a chromatic lens-can travel at any subluminal velocity, forwards or backwards. As a result, an electron can gain enough momentum in the rising edge of the intensity peak to outrun and avoid the trailing edge. Accelerating the intensity peak can further boost the momentum gain. Theory and simulations demonstrate that these dynamic intensity peaks can backwards accelerate electrons to the MeV energies required for radiation and electron diffraction probes of high energy density materials.

"  This article is a part of a project investigating the relationship between the dynamics of completely integrable or close to completely integrable billiard tables, the integral geometry on them, and the spectrum of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operators. It is concerned with new isospectral invariants and with the spectral rigidity problem for families of Laplace-Beltrami operators with Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions, associated with C^1 families of billiard tables. We introduce a notion of weak isospectrality for such deformations. The main dynamical assumption on the initial billiard table is that the corresponding billiard ball map or an iterate of it has a Kronecker invariant torus with a Diophantine frequency and that the corresponding Birkhoff Normal Form is nondegenerate in Kolmogorov sense. Then we obtain C^1 families of Kronecker tori with Diophantine frequencies. If the family of the Laplace-Beltrami operators satisfies the weak isospectral condition, we prove that the average action on the tori and the Birkhoff Normal Form of the billiard ball maps remain the same along the perturbation. As an application we obtain infinitesimal spectral rigidity for Liouville billiard tables in dimensions two and three. Applications are obtained also for strictly convex billiard tables of dimension two as well as in the case when the initial billiard table admits an elliptic periodic billiard trajectory. Spectral rigidity of billard tables close elliptical billiard tables is obtained. The results are based on a construction of C^1 families of quasi-modes associated with the Kronecker tori and on suitable KAM theorems for C^1 families of Hamiltonians. ",mathematics

Second, we demonstrate how the low-energy effective field theory for Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes arising from the spontaneous breakdown of global internal symmetries can be worked out explicitly by integrating out the heavy (Higgs) fields. This makes it possible to analyze the spectrum of NG modes and their interactions without having to deal with mixing of NG and Higgs fields, ubiquitous in the linear-sigma-model description of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

"  The physics of the solar chromosphere is complex from both theoretical and modeling perspectives. The plasma temperature from the photosphere to corona increases from ~5,000 K to ~1 million K over a distance of only ~10,000 km from the chromosphere and the transition region. Certain regions of the solar atmosphere have sufficiently low temperature and ionization rates to be considered as weakly-ionized. In particular, this is true at the lower chromosphere. In this paper, we present an overview of our data-driven magnetohydrodynamics model for the weakly-ionized chromosphere and show a benchmark result. It utilizes the Cowling resistivity which is orders of magnitude greater than the Coulomb resistivity. Ohm's law therefore includes anisotropic dissipation.

"  Hybrid MHD-gyrokinetic code simulations are used to investigate the dynamics of frequency sweeping reversed shear Alfv\'en eigenmode (RSAE) strongly driven by energetic particles (EPs) during plasma current ramp-up in a conventional tokamak configuration. A series of weakly reversed shear equilibria representing time slices of long timescale MHD equilibrium evolution is considered, where the self-consistent RSAE-EP resonant interactions on the short timescale are analyzed in detail. Both linear and nonlinear RSAE dynamics are shown to be subject to the non-perturbative effect of EPs by maximizing wave-EP power transfer. In linear stage, EPs induce evident mode structure and frequency shifts; meanwhile, RSAE saturates by radial decoupling with resonant EPs due to weak magnetic shear, and gives rise to global EP convective transport and non-adiabatic frequency chirping. The spatiotemporal scales of phase space wave-EP interactions are characterized by the perpendicular wavelength and wave-particle trapping time. The simulations provide insights into general as well as specific features of RSAE spectra and EP transport from experimental observations, and illustrate the fundamental physics of wave-EP resonant interaction with the interplay of magnetic geometry, plasma non-uniformity and non-perturbative EPs.

"  Remembering the foundational contributions of Peter Freund to supergravity, and especially to the problems of dimensional compactification, reduction is considered with a non-compact space transverse to the lower dimensional theory. The known problem of a continuum of Kaluza-Klein states is avoided here by the occurrence of a mass gap between a single normalizable zero-eigenvalue transverse wavefunction and the edge of the transverse state continuum.

"  In a time division broadcast positioning system (TDBPS), a user device (UD) determines its position by obtaining sequential time-of-arrival (TOA) or pseudorange measurements from signals broadcast by multiple synchronized base stations (BSs). The existing localization method using sequential pseudorange measurements and a linear clock drift model for the TDPBS, namely LSPM-D, does not compensate the position displacement caused by the UD movement and will result in position error. In this paper, depending on the knowledge of the UD velocity, we develop a set of optimal localization methods for different cases. First, for known UD velocity, we develop the optimal localization method, namely LSPM-KVD, to compensate the movement-caused position error. We show that the LSPM-D is a special case of the LSPM-KVD when the UD is stationary with zero velocity. Second, for the case with unknown UD velocity, we develop a maximum likelihood (ML) method to jointly estimate the UD position and velocity, namely LSPM-UVD. Third, in the case that we have prior distribution information of the UD velocity, we present a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for localization, namely LSPM-PVD. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for all three estimators and analyze their localization error performance. We show that the position error of the LSPM-KVD increases as the assumed known velocity deviates from the true value. As expected, the LSPM-KVD has the smallest position error while the LSPM-PVD and the LSPM-UVD are more robust when the prior knowledge of the UD velocity is limited. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis on the optimality and the positioning accuracy of the proposed methods. ",electrical engineering and systems science
  Localization approach to $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal $SU(N) \times SU(N)$ quiver theory leads to a non-Gaussian two-matrix model representation for the expectation value of BPS circular $SU(N)$ Wilson loop $\langle\mathcal W\rangle$. We study the subleading $1/N^2$ term in the large $N$ expansion of $\langle\mathcal W\rangle$ at weak and strong coupling. We concentrate on the case of the symmetric quiver with equal gauge couplings which is equivalent to the $\mathbb Z_{2}$ orbifold of the $SU(2N)$ $\mathcal N=4$ SYM theory. This orbifold gauge theory should be dual to type IIB superstring in ${\rm AdS}_5\times (S^{5}/\mathbb Z_{2})$.

"  Given a connected cobordism between two knots in the 3-sphere, our main result is an inequality involving torsion orders of the knot Floer homology of the knots, and the number of local maxima and the genus of the cobordism. This has several topological applications: The torsion order gives lower bounds on the bridge index and the band-unlinking number of a knot, the fusion number of a ribbon knot, and the number of minima appearing in a slice disk of a knot. It also gives a lower bound on the number of bands appearing in a ribbon concordance between two knots. Our bounds on the bridge index and fusion number are sharp for $T_{p,q}$ and $T_{p,q}\# \overline{T}_{p,q}$, respectively. We also show that the bridge index of $T_{p,q}$ is minimal within its concordance class.   The torsion order bounds a refinement of the cobordism distance on knots, which is a metric. As a special case, we can bound the number of band moves required to get from one knot to the other. We show knot Floer homology also gives a lower bound on Sarkar's ribbon distance, and exhibit examples of ribbon knots with arbitrarily large ribbon distance from the unknot. ",mathematics

"  The recent detection of GW190521 stimulated ideas on how to populate the predicted black hole pair-instability mass gap. One proposed scenario is the dynamical merger of two stars below the pair instability regime forming a star with a small core and an over-sized envelope. We explore this scenario with detailed stellar evolution calculations, starting with ad-hoc initial conditions enforcing no core growth during the merger. We outline the main challenges this scenario has to overcome, in particular the requirement to retain enough of its mass at merger time, in the subsequent evolution, and at core-collapse. We found that these massive merger products are likely helium-rich, and spend most of their remaining lifetime within regions of the Herzsprung-Russell diagram where envelope instabilities akin to luminous blue variable (LBV) eruptions are expected. An energetic estimate of the amount of mass loss neglecting the back-reaction of the star suggests that the total amount of mass that can be removed at low metallicity is . 1 M . This is small enough that at core-collapse our models are retaining sufficient mass to form black holes in the pair-instability gap similar to the recent ones detected by LIGO/Virgo. However, mass loss at the time of merger and the neutrino-driven mass loss at core collapse still need to be quantified for these models in order to confirm the viability of this scenario.

"  Einstein claimed that the fundamental dynamical insight of special relativity was the equivalence of mass and energy. I disagree. Not only are mass and energy not equivalent (whatever exactly that means) but talk of such equivalence obscures the real dynamical insight of special relativity, which concerns the nature of 4-forces and interactions more generally. In this paper I present and defend a new ontology of special relativistic particle dynamics that makes this insight perspicuous and I explain how alleged cases of mass-energy conversion can be accommodated within that ontology.

"  Low-density spreading non-orthogonal multiple-access (LDS-NOMA) is considered where $K$ single-antenna user-equipments (UEs) communicate with a base-station (BS) over $F$ fading sub-carriers. Each UE $k$ spreads its data symbols over $d_k<F$ sub-carriers. We aim to identify the LDS-code allocations that maximize the ergodic mutual information (EMI). The BS assigns resources solely based on pathlosses. Conducting analysis in the regime where $F$, $K$, and ${d_k,\forall k}$ converge to $+\infty$ at the same rate, we present EMI as a deterministic equivalent plus a residual term. The deterministic equivalent is a function of pathlosses and spreading codes, and the small residual term scales as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\min(d_k^2)})$. We formulate an optimization problem to get the set of all spreading codes, irrespective of sparsity constraints, which maximize the deterministic EMI. This yields a simple resource allocation rule that facilitates the construction of desired LDS-codes via an efficient partitioning algorithm. The acquired LDS-codes additionally harness the small incremental gain inherent in the residual term, and thus, attain near-optimal values of EMI in the finite regime. While regular LDS-NOMA is found to be asymptotically optimal in symmetric models, an irregular spreading arises in generic asymmetric cases. The spectral efficiency enhancement relative to regular and random spreading is validated numerically. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Elliptic nozzle geometry is attractive for mixing enhancement of supersonic jets. However, jet dynamics, such as flapping, gives rise to high-intensity tonal sound. We experimentally manipulate the supersonic elliptic jet morphology by using two sharp-tipped lobes. The lobes are placed on either end of the minor axis in an elliptic nozzle. The design Mach number and the aspect ratio of the elliptic nozzle and the lobed nozzle are 2.0 and 1.65. The supersonic jet is exhausted into ambient at almost perfectly expanded conditions. Time-resolved schlieren imaging, longitudinal and cross-sectional planar laser Mie-scattering imaging, planar Particle Image Velocimetry, and near-field microphone measurements are performed to assess the fluidic behavior of the two nozzles. Dynamic Mode and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (DMD and POD) analysis are carried out on the schlieren and the Mie-scattering images. Mixing characteristics are extracted from the Mie-scattering images through the image processing routines. The flapping elliptic jet consists of two dominant DMD modes, while the lobed nozzle has only one dominant mode, and the flapping is suppressed. Microphone measurements show the associated noise reduction. The jet column bifurcates in the lobed nozzle enabling a larger surface contact area with the ambient fluid and higher mixing rates in the near-field of the nozzle exit. The jet width growth rate of the two-lobed nozzle is about twice as that of the elliptic jet in the near-field, and there is a 40\% reduction in the potential core length. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) contours substantiate the results. ",physics

The dependence of the time variation of p/He on the local interstellar spectrum (LIS) shape and on the mass-to-charge ratio, A/Z, is analyzed in detail. We find that, depending on the rigidity range and the sign of the spectral index of the p/He LIS ratio, the p/He time variation can be correlated or anti-correlated with the phase of the solar cycle. We show that the A/Z dependence is the most probable cause for the p/He decrease recently observed by AMS-02 after 2015 between 2 and 3 GV. ",astrophysics

"  The three key elements of a quantum simulation are state preparation, time evolution, and measurement. While the complexity scaling of dynamics and measurements are well known, many state preparation methods are strongly system-dependent and require prior knowledge of the system's eigenvalue spectrum. Here, we report on a quantum-classical implementation of the coupled-cluster Green's function (CCGF) method, which replaces explicit ground state preparation with the task of applying unitary operators to a simple product state. While our approach is broadly applicable to a wide range of models, we demonstrate it here for the Anderson impurity model (AIM). The method requires a number of T gates that grows as $ \mathcal{O} \left(N^5 \right)$ per time step to calculate the impurity Green's function in the time domain, where $N$ is the total number of energy levels in the AIM. For comparison, a classical CCGF calculation of the same order would require computational resources that grow as $ \mathcal{O} \left(N^6 \right)$ per time step. ",quantum physics
"  We study the problem of detecting whether an inhomogeneous random graph contains a planted community. Specifically, we observe a single realization of a graph. Under the null hypothesis, this graph is a sample from an inhomogeneous random graph, whereas under the alternative, there exists a small subgraph where the edge probabilities are increased by a multiplicative scaling factor. We present a scan test that is able to detect the presence of such a planted community, even when this community is very small and the underlying graph is inhomogeneous. We also derive an information theoretic lower bound for this problem which shows that in some regimes the scan test is almost asymptotically optimal. We illustrate our results through examples and numerical experiments. ",mathematics
"  We consider estimation of a total causal effect from observational data via covariate adjustment. Ideally, adjustment sets are selected based on a given causal graph, reflecting knowledge of the underlying causal structure. Valid adjustment sets are, however, not unique. Recent research has introduced a graphical criterion for an 'optimal' valid adjustment set (O-set). For a given graph, adjustment by the O-set yields the smallest asymptotic variance compared to other adjustment sets in certain parametric and non-parametric models. In this paper, we provide three new results on the O-set. First, we give a novel, more intuitive graphical characterisation: We show that the O-set is the parent set of the outcome node(s) in a suitable latent projection graph, which we call the forbidden projection. An important property is that the forbidden projection preserves all information relevant to total causal effect estimation via covariate adjustment, making it a useful methodological tool in its own right. Second, we extend the existing IDA algorithm to use the O-set, and argue that the algorithm remains semi-local. This is implemented in the R-package pcalg. Third, we present assumptions under which the O-set can be viewed as the target set of popular non-graphical variable selection algorithms such as stepwise backward selection. ",mathematics

"  In an effort to probe the origin of surface brightness profile (SBP) breaks widely observed in nearby disk galaxies, we carry out a comparative study of stellar population profiles of 635 disk galaxies selected from the MaNGA spectroscopic survey. We classify our galaxies into single exponential (TI), down-bending (TII) and up-bending (TIII) SBP types, and derive their spin parameters and radial profiles of age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features. Most TII (TIII) galaxies have down-bending (up-bending) star formation rate (SFR) radial profiles, implying that abrupt radial changes of SFR intensities contribute to the formation of both TII and TIII breaks. Nevertheless, a comparison between our galaxies and simulations suggests that stellar migration plays a significant role in weakening down-bending $\Sigma_{\star}$ profile breaks. While there is a correlation between the break strengths of SBPs and age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features for TII galaxies, no such correlation is found for TIII galaxies, indicating that stellar migration may not play a major role in shaping TIII breaks, as is evidenced by a good correspondence between break strengths of $\Sigma_{\star}$ and surface brightness profiles of TIII galaxies. We do not find evidence for galaxy spin being a relevant parameter for forming different SBP types, nor do we find significant differences between the asymmetries of galaxies with different SBP types, suggesting that environmental disturbances or satellite accretion in the recent past do not significantly influence the break formation. By dividing our sample into early and late morphological types, we find that galaxies with different SBP types follow nearly the same tight stellar mass-$R_{25}$ relation, which makes the hypothesis that stellar migration alone can transform SBP types from TII to TI and then to TIII highly unlikely.

"  Based on the motivation that some quantum gravity theories predicts the Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) around Planck-scale energy levels, this paper proposes a new formalism that addresses the possible effects of LIV in the electrodynamics. This formalism is capable of changing the usual electrodynamics through high derivative arbitrary mass dimension terms that includes a constant background field controlling the intensity of LIV in the models, producing modifications in the dispersion relations in a manner that is similar to the Myers-Pospelov approach. With this framework, it was possible to generate a CPT-even and CPT-odd generalized modifications of the electrodynamics in order to study the stability and causality of these theories considering the isotropic case for the background field. An additional analysis of unitarity at tree level was considered by studying the saturated propagators. After this analysis, we conclude that, while CPT-even modifications always preserves the stability, causality and unitarity in the boundaries of the effective field theory and therefore may be good candidates for field theories with interactions, the CPT-odd one violates causality and unitarity. This feature is a consequence of the vacuum birefringence characteristics that are present in CPT-odd theories for the photon sector. ",high energy physics theory

We do this via a connection between traversable wormholes and graph geometries on which we can perform quantum random walks for signal transmission. As a proof of principle, we give an example of a geometry for which quantum random walk signal traversal occurs exponentially faster than a standard ballistic classical traversal. We then generalize this connection to superpositions over holographic states, and argue that the quantum random walk/graph geometry picture works to study quantum channel properties of such states.

"  We extend a 2d topological model of the gravitational path integral to include sums over spin structure, corresponding to Neveu-Schwarz (NS) or Ramond (R) boundary conditions for fermions. The Euclidean path integral vanishes when the number of R boundaries is odd. This path integral corresponds to a correlator of boundary creation operators on a non-trivial baby universe Hilbert space. The non-factorization necessitates a dual interpretation of the bulk path integral in terms of a product of partition functions (associated to NS boundaries) and Witten indices (associated to R boundaries), averaged over an ensemble of theories with varying Hilbert space dimension and different numbers of bosonic and fermionic states. We also consider a model with End-of-the-World (EOW) branes: the dual ensemble then includes a sum over randomly chosen fermionic and bosonic states. We propose two modifications of the bulk path integral which restore an interpretation in a single dual theory: (i) a geometric prescription where we add extra boundaries with a sum over their spin structures, and (ii) an algebraic prescription involving ""spacetime D-branes"".

We employ a hypoelastoplastic mechanical model, and develop a projection method to enforce quasistatic equilibrium. We introduce a simulation framework that uses a fixed Cartesian computational grid on a reference domain, and which imposes deformation via a time-dependent coordinate transformation to the physical domain.

We examine the growth of shear bands in simple shear and pure shear conditions as a function of the initial preparation of the bulk metallic glass. ",physics

A particular focus is on the development of efficient numerical algorithms to design optimal linear feedback controllers when there are many inputs (disturbances applied everywhere) and many outputs (perturbations measured everywhere). We propose a resolvent-based iterative algorithm to perform i) optimal estimation of the flow using a limited number of sensors; and ii) optimal control of the flow when the entire flow is known but only a limited number of actuators are available for control. The method uses resolvent analysis to take advantage of the low-rank characteristics of the cylinder wake and solutions are obtained without any model-order reduction. Optimal feedback controllers are also obtained by combining the solutions of the estimation and control problems. We show that the performance of the estimators and controllers converges to the true global optima, indicating that the important physical mechanisms for estimation and control are of low rank.

"  This paper investigates the hybrid precoding design in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with a fully-adaptive-connected precoding structure, where a switch-controlled connection is deployed between every antenna and every radio frequency (RF) chain. To maximally enhance the energy efficiency (EE) of hybrid precoding under this structure, the joint optimization of switch-controlled connections and the hybrid precoders is formulated as a large-scale mixed-integer non-convex problem with high-dimensional power constraints. To efficiently solve such a challenging problem, we first decouple it into a continuous hybrid precoding (CHP) subproblem. Then, with the hybrid precoder obtained from the CHP subproblem, the original problem can be equivalently reformulated as a discrete connection-state (DCS) problem with only 0-1 integer variables. For the CHP subproblem, we propose an alternating hybrid precoding (AHP) algorithm. Then, with the hybrid precoder provided by the AHP algorithm, we develop a matching assisted fully-adaptive hybrid precoding (MA-FAHP) algorithm to solve the DCS problem. It is theoretically shown that the proposed MA-FAHP algorithm always converges to a stable solution with the polynomial complexity. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the superior performance of the proposed MA-FAHP algorithm in terms of EE and beampattern. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Modern single image super-resolution (SISR) system based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieves fancy performance while requires huge computational costs. The problem on feature redundancy is well studied in visual recognition task, but rarely discussed in SISR. Based on the observation that many features in SISR models are also similar to each other, we propose to use shift operation to generate the redundant features (i.e., Ghost features). Compared with depth-wise convolution which is not friendly to GPUs or NPUs, shift operation can bring practical inference acceleration for CNNs on common hardware. We analyze the benefits of shift operation for SISR and make the shift orientation learnable based on Gumbel-Softmax trick. For a given pre-trained model, we first cluster all filters in each convolutional layer to identify the intrinsic ones for generating intrinsic features. Ghost features will be derived by moving these intrinsic features along a specific orientation. The complete output features are constructed by concatenating the intrinsic and ghost features together. Extensive experiments on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that both the non-compact and lightweight SISR models embedded in our proposed module can achieve comparable performance to that of their baselines with large reduction of parameters, FLOPs and GPU latency. For instance, we reduce the parameters by 47%, FLOPs by 46% and GPU latency by 41% of EDSR x2 network without significant performance degradation. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  The objectives were to develop a novel three-dimensional technology for imaging naturally occurring shear wave (SW) propagation, demonstrate feasibility on human volunteers and quantify SW velocity in different propagation directions. Imaging of natural SWs generated by valve closures has emerged to obtain a direct measurement of cardiac stiffness. Recently, natural SW velocity was assessed in two dimensions on parasternal long axis view under the assumption of a propagation direction along the septum. However, in this approach the source localization and the complex three-dimensional propagation wave path was neglected making the speed estimation unreliable. High volume rate transthoracic acquisitions of the human left ventricle (1100 volume/s) was performed with a 4D ultrafast echocardiographic scanner. Four-dimensional tissue velocity cineloops enabled visualization of aortic and mitral valve closure waves. Energy and time of flight mapping allowed propagation path visualization and source localization, respectively. Velocities were quantified along different directions. Aortic and mitral valve closure SW velocities were assessed for the three volunteers with low standard deviation. Anisotropic propagation was also found suggesting the necessity of using a three-dimensional imaging approach. Different velocities were estimated for the three directions for the aortic (3.4$\pm$0.1 m/s, 3.5$\pm$0.3 m/s, 5.4$\pm$0.7 m/s) and the mitral (2.8$\pm$0.5 m/s, 2.9$\pm$0.3 m/s, 4.6$\pm$0.7 m/s) valve SWs. 4D ultrafast ultrasound alleviates the limitations of 2D ultrafast ultrasound for cardiac SW imaging based on natural SW propagations and enables a comprehensive measurement of cardiac stiffness. This technique could provide stiffness mapping of the left ventricle. ",physics

"  Tensor contractions are ubiquitous in computational chemistry and physics, where tensors generally represent states or operators and contractions are transformations. In this context, the states and operators often preserve physical conservation laws, which are manifested as group symmetries in the tensors. These group symmetries imply that each tensor has block sparsity and can be stored in a reduced form. For nontrivial contractions, the memory footprint and cost are lowered, respectively, by a linear and a quadratic factor in the number of symmetry sectors. State-of-the-art tensor contraction software libraries exploit this opportunity by iterating over blocks or using general block-sparse tensor representations. Both approaches entail overhead in performance and code complexity. With intuition aided by tensor diagrams, we present a technique, irreducible representation alignment, which enables efficient handling of Abelian group symmetries via only dense tensors, by using contraction-specific reduced forms. This technique yields a general algorithm for arbitrary group symmetric contractions, which we implement in Python and apply to a variety of representative contractions from quantum chemistry and tensor network methods. As a consequence of relying on only dense tensor contractions, we can easily make use of efficient batched matrix multiplication via Intel's MKL and distributed tensor contraction via the Cyclops library, achieving good efficiency and parallel scalability on up to 4096 Knights Landing cores of a supercomputer.

"  Gauge theories possess non-local features that, in the presence of boundaries, inevitably lead to subtleties. In this article, we continue our study of a unified solution based on a geometric tool operating on field-space: a connection form. We specialize to the $D+1$ formulation of Yang-Mills theories on configuration space, and we precisely characterize the gluing of the Yang-Mills field across regions. In the $D+1$ formalism, the connection-form splits the electric degrees of freedom into their pure-radiative and Coulombic components, rendering the latter as conjugate to the pure-gauge part of the gauge potential. Regarding gluing, we obtain a characterization for topologically simple regions through closed formulas. These formulas exploit the properties of a generalized Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator defined at the gluing surface; through them, we find only the radiative components and the local charges are relevant for gluing. Finally, we study the gluing into topologically non-trivial regions in 1+1 dimensions. We find that in this case, the regional radiative modes do not fully determine the global radiative mode (Aharonov-Bohm phases). For the global mode takes a new contribution from the kernel of the gluing formula, a kernel which is associated to non-trivial cohomological cycles. In no circumstances do we find a need for postulating new local degrees of freedom at boundaries. $\text{The partial results of these notes have been completed and substantially clarified in a more recent, comprehensive article from October 2019.

"  Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we discuss the full set of proper BRST and anti-BRST transformations for a 2D diffeomorphism invariant theory which is described by the Lagrangian density of a standard bosonic string.

The latter property is valid on a submanifold of the space of the quantum fields where the 2D version of the universal (anti-)BRST invariant Curci-Ferrari (CF) type of restrictions are satisfied. We derive the precise forms of the BRST and anti-BRST invariant Lagrangian densities as well as the exact expressions for the conserved (anti-)BRST and ghost charges. The lucid derivation of the proper anti-BRST symmetry transformations and the emergence of the CF-type restrictions are completely novel results for our present bosonic string which has already been discussed earlier in literature where only the BRST symmetry transformations have been pointed out.

"  Using cross-correlation current noise spectroscopy, we have investigated carrier dynamics in methylammonium lead triiodide solar cells. This method provides a space selectivity for devices with planar multi-layered structure, effectively amplifying current noise contributions coming from the most resistive element of the stack. In the studied solar cells, we observe near full-scale shot noise, indicating the dominance of noise generation by a single source, likely the interface between the perovskite and the spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer. We argue that the strong 1/f noise term has contributions both from the perovskite layer and interfaces. It displays non-ideal dependence on photocurrent, $S \propto I^{1.4}$ (instead of usual $S \propto I^2$ ), which is likely due to current-induced halide migration. Finally, we observe generation-recombination noise. The relaxation time of this process grows linearly with photocurrent, which allows to attribute this contribution to bimolecular recombination in the perovskite bulk absorption layer. Extrapolating our results, we estimate that at the standard 1 sun illumination the electron-hole recombination time is 5 microseconds. ",physics

"  In gamma-ray astronomy through Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT), the atmosphere is used as a calorimeter. Incident gamma-rays in the GeV-TeV energy range are observed through the electromagnetic showers they produce in the atmosphere and the Cherenkov light emitted by them. We aim to obtain a parameterisation of the longitudinal profiles of electromagnetic showers in the atmosphere. The longitudinal Cherenkov emission profiles of these showers can be used for the reconstruction of the parameters of the gamma-photon as well gamma-hadron discrimination. Obtaining an accurate parameterisation of these profiles can therefore be used in the analysis of IACT images as well as fast simulation of the Cherenkov emission from gamma-induced showers in the atmosphere. Such parameterisations are not known to have been systematically carried out prior to this. We carry out Monte Carlo simulations of gamma-induced showers in the atmosphere. The parameterisation of their Cherenkov emission longitudinal profiles is based on the well-known gamma-function used in particle detector physics. We evaluate the dependence of the depth of the maximum and the average depth of the longitudinal Cherenkov emission profile, as well as the parameter $1/\beta$ on the energy of the initial shower. We also study the distributions of various parameters associated with the gamma-function and find that $\beta/\alpha$ and $1/\alpha$ have Gaussian distributions and are not correlated with each other which makes them appropriate variables for evaluating the fluctuations of the Cherenkov emission profiles.

"  We use self-similarity in N-body simulations of scale-free models to test for resolution dependence in the mass function and two-point correlation functions of dark matter halos. We use 1024$^3$ particle simulations performed with ABACUS, and compare results obtained with two halo finders: friends-of-friends (FOF) and ROCKSTAR. The FOF mass functions show a systematic deviation from self-similarity which is explained by resolution dependence of the FOF mass assignment previously reported in the literature. Weak evidence for convergence is observed only starting from halos of several thousand particles, and mass functions are overestimated by at least as much as 20-25 percent for halos of 50 particles. The mass function of the default ROCKSTAR halo catalog (with bound virial spherical overdensity mass), on the other hand, shows good convergence from of order 50 to 100 particles per halo, with no detectable evidence at the few percent level of any systematic dependence for larger particle number. Tests show that the mass unbinding procedure in ROCKSTAR is the key factor in obtaining this much improved resolution. Applying the same analysis to the halo-halo two point correlation function, we find again strong evidence for convergence only for ROCKSTAR halos, at separations sufficiently large so that halos do not overlap. At these separations we can exclude dependence on resolution at the 5-10 percent level once halos have of order 50 to 100 particles. At smaller separations results are not converged even at significantly larger particle number, and bigger simulations would be required to establish the resolution required for convergence.

Before reaching the singularity, there are several intermediate regimes which we study both analytically and numerically. These include strong Josephson oscillations in the condensate and possible 'Kasner inversions' in which after many e-folds of expansion, the Einstein-Rosen bridge contracts towards the singularity. Due to the Josephson oscillations, the number of Kasner inversions depends very sensitively on $T$, and diverges at a discrete set of temperatures $\{T_n\}$ that accumulate at $T_c$.

"  We provide an introduction to the theory of quantum measurements that is centered on the pivotal role played by John von Neumann's model. This introduction is accessible to students and researchers from outside the field of foundations of quantum mechanics and presented within a historical context. We first explain the origins and the meaning of the measurement problem in quantum theory, and why it is not present in classical physics. We perform a chronological review of the quantization of action and explain how this led to successive restrictions on what could be measured in atomic phenomena, until the consolidation of the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics. The clear separation between quantum system and classical apparatus that causes these restrictions is subverted in von Neumann's paradigmatic model of quantum measurements, a subject whose concepts we explain, while also providing the mathematical tools necessary to apply it to new problems. We show how this model was important in discussing the interpretations of quantum mechanics and how it is still relevant in modern applications. In particular, we explain in detail how it can be used to describe weak measurements and the surprising results they entail. We also discuss the limitations of von Neumann's model of measurements, and explain how they can be overcome with POVMs and Kraus operators. We provide the mathematical tools necessary to work with these generalized measurements and to derive master equations from them. Finally, we demonstrate how these can be applied in research problems by calculating the Quantum Zeno Effect. ",quantum physics
"  The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea (OSAH) syndrome is a very common and frequently undiagnosed sleep disorder. It is characterized by repeated events of partial (hypopnea) or total (apnea) obstruction of the upper airway while sleeping. This study makes use of a previously developed method called DAS-KSVD for multiclass structured dictionary learning to automatically detect individual events of apnea and hypopnea using only blood oxygen saturation signals. The method uses a combined discriminant measure which is capable of efficiently quantifying the degree of discriminability of each one of the atoms in a dictionary. DAS-KSVD was applied to detect and classify apnea and hypopnea events from signals obtained from the Sleep Heart Health Study database. For moderate to severe OSAH screening, a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the results shows an area under the curve of 0.957 and diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 87.56% and 88.32%, respectively. These results represent improvements as compared to most state-of-the-art procedures. Hence, the method could be used for screening OSAH syndrome more reliably and conveniently, using only a pulse oximeter. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Quantum mechanics allows the distribution of intrinsically secure encryption keys by optical means. Twin-field quantum key distribution is the most promising technique for its implementation on long-distance fibers, but requires stabilizing the optical length of the communication channels between parties. In proof-of-principle experiments based on spooled fibers, this was achieved by interleaving the quantum communication with periodical adjustment frames. In this approach, longer duty cycles for the key streaming come at the cost of a looser control of channel length, and a successful key-transfer using this technique in a real world remains a significant challenge. Using interferometry techniques derived from frequency metrology, we developed a solution for the simultaneous key streaming and channel length control, and demonstrate it on a 206 km field-deployed fiber with 65 dB loss. Our technique reduces the quantum-bit-error-rate contributed by channel length variations to <1%, representing an effective solution for real-world quantum communications. ",quantum physics

"  We compute the circuit complexity of scalar curvature perturbations on FLRW cosmological backgrounds with fixed equation of state $w$ using the language of squeezed vacuum states. Backgrounds that are accelerating and expanding, or decelerating and contracting, exhibit features consistent with chaotic behavior, including linearly growing complexity. Remarkably, we uncover a bound on the growth of complexity for both expanding and contracting backgrounds $\lambda \leq \sqrt{2} \ |H|$, similar to other bounds proposed independently in the literature. The bound is saturated for expanding backgrounds with an equation of state more negative than $w = -5/3$, and for contracting backgrounds with an equation of state larger than $w = 1$. For expanding backgrounds that preserve the null energy condition, de Sitter space has the largest rate of growth of complexity (identified as the Lyapunov exponent), and we find a scrambling time that is similar to other estimates up to order one factors.

"  We present a fine grid of solar metallicity models of massive stars (320 in the range 12$\leq$M(\msun)$\leq$27.95), extending from the Main Sequence up to the onset of the collapse, in order to quantitatively determine how their compactness $\xi_{2.5}$ (as defined by O'Connor $\&$ Ott, 2011, ApJ 730, 70) scales with the Carbon Oxygen core mass at the beginning of the core collapse. We find a well defined, not monotonic (but not scattered) trend of the compactness with the Carbon Oxygen core mass that is strictly (and mainly) correlated to the behavior, i.e. birth, growth and disappearance, of the various C convective episodes that follow one another during the advanced evolutionary phases. Though both the mass size of the Carbon Oxygen core and the amount of \nuk{C}{12} left by the He burning play a major role in sculpting the final Mass-Radius relation, it is the abundance of \nuk{C}{12} the ultimate responsible for the final degree of compactness of a star because it controls the ability of the C burning shell to advance in mass before the final collapse.

"  A new Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) method for solving nonlinear least squares problems with convex constraints is described. Various versions of this method have been proposed, their main differences being in the choice of damping parameter. In this paper, we propose a new rule for updating the damping parameter that is based on the perspective of majorization-minimization method. Our method finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and converges locally quadratically under a local error bound condition. These properties are guaranteed even when the subproblems are solved inexactly, which reduces the computational cost per iteration of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first LM method that has an iteration complexity bound for constrained problems. Numerical results show that our method achieves better global performance than those of two existing LM methods and the projected gradient method. ",mathematics

We focus on deriving the asymptotic normality of probability score-based estimators under parametric, nonparametric and semiparametric structure. We make a systematic study on the estimation efficiency to check the importance of propensity score structure and the essential differences from the unconditional counterparts. The derived unique properties can answer: what is the general ranking of these estimators? how does the affiliation of the given covariates to the set of covariates of the propensity score affect the efficiency? how does the convergence rate of the estimated propensity score affect the efficiency? and why would semiparametric estimation be worth of recommendation in practice? We also give a brief discussion on the extension of the methods to handle large-dimensional scenarios and on the estimation for the asymptotic variances. The simulation studies are conducted to examine the performances of these estimators. A real data example is analyzed for illustration and some new findings are acquired. ",mathematics

We also evaluate the time averaged complexity, provide evidence of non-analytic behavior at the critical points, and discuss its origin. Finally, we comment on the freezing of quantum dynamics at specific configurations and on the use of complexity as a new tool to understand quantum phase transitions in Floquet systems.

"  We present Asynchronous Stochastic Parallel Pose Graph Optimization (ASAPP), the first asynchronous algorithm for distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping. By enabling robots to optimize their local trajectory estimates without synchronization, ASAPP offers resiliency against communication delays and alleviates the need to wait for stragglers in the network. Furthermore, ASAPP can be applied on the rank-restricted relaxations of PGO, a crucial class of non-convex Riemannian optimization problems that underlies recent breakthroughs on globally optimal PGO. Under bounded delay, we establish the global first-order convergence of ASAPP using a sufficiently small stepsize. The derived stepsize depends on the worst-case delay and inherent problem sparsity, and furthermore matches known result for synchronous algorithms when there is no delay. Numerical evaluations on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art synchronous approach, and show ASAPP's resilience against a wide range of delays in practice.

"  Fixed node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is an increasingly used computational approach for investigating the electronic structure of molecules, solids, and surfaces with controllable accuracy. It stands out among equally accurate electronic structure approaches for its favorable cubic scaling with system size, which often makes FN-DMC the only computationally affordable high-quality method in large condensed phase systems with more than 100 atoms. In such systems FN-DMC deploys pseudopotentials to substantially improve efficiency. In order to deal with non-local terms of pseudopotentials, the FN-DMC algorithm must use an additional approximation, leading to the so-called localization error. However, the two available approximations, the locality approximation (LA) and the T-move approximation (TM), have certain disadvantages and can make DMC calculations difficult to reproduce. Here we introduce a third approach, called the determinant localization approximation (DLA). DLA eliminates reproducibility issues and systematically provides good quality results and stable simulations that are slightly more efficient than LA and TM. When calculating energy differences -- such as interaction and ionization energies -- DLA is also more accurate than the LA and TM approaches. We believe that DLA paves the way to the automization of FN-DMC and its much easier application in large systems. ",physics
"  We present a numerical method for two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with jump discontinuity in the normal component of the stress tensor and in the material properties. Although the proposed method is only first-order accurate, it does capture discontinuity sharply, not neglecting nor omitting any component of the jump condition. Discontinuities in velocity gradient and pressure are expressed using a linear combination of singular force and tangential derivatives of velocities to handle jump conditions in a fully implicit manner. The linear system for the divergence of the stress tensor is constructed in the framework of the ghost fluid method, and the resulting saddle-point system is solved via an iterative procedure. Numerical results support the inference that the proposed method converges in $L^\infty$ norms even when velocities and pressures are not smooth across the interface and can handle a large density ratio that is likely to appear in a real-world simulation.

"  We model the time dependent radio emission from a disk accretion event in a T-Tauri star using 3D, ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations combined with a gyrosynchrotron emission and radiative transfer model. We predict for the first time, the multi-frequency (1$-$1000 GHz) intensity and circular polarisation from a flaring T-Tauri star. A flux tube, connecting the star with its circumstellar disk, is populated with a distribution of non-thermal electrons which is allowed to decay exponentially after a heating event in the disk and the system is allowed to evolve. The energy distribution of the electrons, as well as the non-thermal power law index and loss rate, are varied to see their effect on the overall flux. Spectra are generated from different lines of sight, giving different views of the flux tube and disk. The peak flux typically occurs around 20$-$30 GHz and the radio luminosity is consistent with that observed from T-Tauri stars. For all simulations, the peak flux is found to decrease and move to lower frequencies with elapsing time. The frequency-dependent circular polarisation can reach 10$-$30$\%$ but has a complex structure which evolves as the flare evolves. Our models show that observations of the evolution of the spectrum and its polarisation can provide important constraints on physical properties of the flaring environment and associated accretion event.

"  Digital-to-analog converters (DAC) are indispensable functional units in signal processing instrumentation and wide-band telecommunication links for both civil and military applications. Since photonic systems are capable of high data throughput and low latency, an increasingly found system limitation stems from the required domain-crossing such as digital-to-analog, and electronic-to-optical. A photonic DAC implementation, in contrast, enables a seamless signal conversion with respect to both energy efficiency and short signal delay, often require bulky discrete optical components and electric-optic transformation hence introducing inefficiencies. Here, we introduce a novel coherent parallel photonic DAC concept along with an experimental demonstration capable of performing this digital-to-analog conversion without optic-electric-optic domain crossing. This design hence guarantees a linear intensity weighting among bits operating at high sampling rates, yet at a reduced footprint and power consumption compared to other photonic alternatives. Importantly, this photonic DAC could create seamless interfaces of next-generation data processing hardware for data-centers, task-specific compute accelerators such as neuromorphic engines, and network edge processing applications.

"  Diagnosis of high impedance fault (HIF) is a challenge for nowadays distribution network protections. The fault current of a HIF is much lower than that of a normal load, and fault feature is significantly affected by fault scenarios. A detection and feeder identification algorithm for HIFs is proposed in this paper, based on the high-resolution and synchronous waveform data. In the algorithm, an interval slope is defined to describe the waveform distortions, which guarantees a uniform feature description under various HIF nonlinearities and noise interferences. For three typical types of network neutrals, i.e.,isolated neutral, resonant neutral, and low-resistor-earthed neutral, differences of the distorted components between the zero-sequence currents of healthy and faulty feeders are mathematically deduced, respectively. As a result, the proposed criterion, which is based on the distortion relationships between zero-sequence currents of feeders and the zero-sequence voltage at the substation, is theoretically supported. 28 HIFs grounded to various materials are tested in a 10kV distribution networkwith three neutral types, and are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

"  We introduce a notion of fractional convexity that extends naturally the usual notion of convexity in the Euclidean space to a fractional setting. With this notion of fractional convexity, we study the fractional convex envelope inside a domain of an exterior datum (the largest possible fractional convex function inside the domain that is below the datum outside) and show that the fractional convex envelope is characterized as a viscosity solution to a non-local equation that is given by the infimum among all possible directions of the $1-$dimensional fractional Laplacian. For this equation we prove existence, uniqueness and a comparison principle (in the framework of viscosity solutions). In addition, we find that solutions to the equation for the convex envelope are related to solutions to the fractional Monge-Ampere equation. ",mathematics
"  Traditional video compression technologies have been developed over decades in pursuit of higher coding efficiency. Efficient temporal information representation plays a key role in video coding. Thus, in this paper, we propose to exploit the temporal correlation using both first-order optical flow and second-order flow prediction.

Joint priors are embedded in autoregressive spatial neighbors, co-located hyper elements and temporal neighbors using ConvLSTM recurrently. We evaluate our approach for the low-delay scenario with High-Efficiency Video Coding (H.265/HEVC), H.264/AVC and another learned video compression method, following the common test settings.

"  Current research in High Energy Cosmic Ray Physics touches on fundamental questions regarding the origin of cosmic rays, their composition, the acceleration mechanisms, and their production. Unambiguous measurements of the energy spectra and of the composition of cosmic rays at the ""knee"" region could provide some of the answers to the above questions. So far only ground based observations, which rely on sophisticated models describing high energy interactions in the earth's atmosphere, have been possible due to the extremely low particle rates at these energies. A calorimetry based space experiment that could provide not only flux measurements but also energy spectra and particle identification, would certainly overcome some of the uncertainties of ground based experiments. Given the expected particle fluxes, a very large acceptance is needed to collect a sufficient quantity of data, in a time compatible with the duration of a space mission. This in turn, contrasts with the lightness and compactness requirements for space based experiments. We present a novel idea in calorimetry which addresses these issues whilst limiting the mass and volume of the detector. In this paper we report on a four year R&D program where we investigated materials, coatings, photo-sensors, Front End electronics, and mechanical structures with the aim of designing a high performance, high granularity calorimeter with the largest possible acceptance. Details are given of the design choices, component characterisation, and of the construction of a sizeable prototype (Calocube) which has been used in various tests with particle beams. ",physics

To check the validity of our analytic calculations, we compare results of the continued fraction method in the near extremal limit with the analytic results obtained in the previous paper.

"  The covariant Noether charge formalism (also known as the covariant phase method) of Wald and collaborators, including its cohomological extension, is a manifestly covariant Hamiltonian formalism that, in principle, allows one to define and compute the energy, angular momenta, and chemical potentials of generic solutions of gravitational theories. However, it has been observed that for some supergravity solutions the variation of the Noether charge is not (at least manifestably) integrable, and as a result it is unclear whether there are well-defined thermodynamic charges for these solutions. In this work, we derive an expression for the variation of the covariant Noether charges for any solution of Type IIB 10-dimensional supergravity or 11-dimensional supergravity. Although this Noether quantity is not integrable in general, we show that for asymptotically scale-invariant solutions, it is. In particular, the asymptotic scale-invariance allows one to define an energy density and conjugate chemical potentials which obey a first law of thermodynamics and a Smarr relation. These two thermodynamic relations can then be shown to imply that the variation of the Noether charge is integrable, and accordingly the energy and other thermodynamic charges may be defined unambiguously. We explicitly demonstrate and illustrate our claim by computing the thermodynamic charges of two non-trivial supergravity solutions that were recently constructed: 1) the Polchinski-Strassler black brane that is dual to the deconfined phase of $\mathcal{N}=1^*$ theory, and 2) the CGLP black brane that asymptotes to the mass deformed Cveti\v{c}-Gibbons-L\""u-Pope (CGLP) solution.

"  This paper considers the application of FPGA-based IIR filtering to increase the usable bandwidth of a piezoelectric transducer used in optical phase locking. We experimentally perform system identification of the interferometer system with the cross-correlation method integrated on the controller hardware. Our model is then used to implement an inverse filter designed to suppress the low frequency resonant modes of the piezo-electric transducer. This filter is realized as an 24th-order IIR filter on the FPGA, while the total input-output delay is kept at 350ns. The combination of the inverse filter and the piezo-electric transducer works as a nearly-flat response position actuator, allowing us to use PI control in order to achieve stability of the closed-loop system with significant improvements over non filtered PI control. Finally, because this controller is completely digital, it is straight forward to reproduce. Our control scheme is suitable for many experiments which require highly accurate control of flexible structures. ",physics

We also identify what is called a point of no return, a delay threshold of about 100 days that results in masking enforcement having little significant impact on the Maximum Infected Values.

"  Recent developments in enhanced sampling methods showed that it is possible to reconstruct ligand unbinding pathways with spatial and temporal resolution inaccessible to experiments. Ideally, such techniques should provide an atomistic definition of possibly many reaction pathways, because crude estimates may lead either to overestimating energy barriers, or inability to sample hidden energy barriers that are not captured by reaction pathway estimates.

"  Magnetic fields influence the formation and evolution of stars and impact the observed stellar properties. Ap stars (magnetic A-type stars) are a prime example of this. Access to precise and accurate determinations of their stellar fundamental properties, such as masses and ages, is crucial to understand the origin and evolution of fossil magnetic fields. We propose using the radii and luminosities determined from interferometric measurements, in addition to seismic constraints when available, to infer fundamental properties of 14 Ap stars pr\'eviously characterised. We used a grid-based modelling approach, employing stellar models computed with the \textsc{cestam} stellar evolution code, and the parameter search performed with the \textsc{aims} optimisation method. The stellar model grid was built using a wide range of initial helium abundances and metallicities in order to avoid any bias originating from the initial chemical composition. The large frequency separations ($\Delta\nu$) of HR\,1217 (HD\,24712) and $\alpha$~Cir (HD\,128898), two rapidly oscillating Ap stars of the sample, were used as seismic constraints. We inferred the fundamental properties of the 14 stars in the sample. The overall results are consistent within $1\sigma$ with previous studies, however, the stellar masses inferred in this study are higher. This trend likely originates from the broader range of chemical compositions considered in this work. We show that the use of $\Delta\nu$ in the modelling significantly improves our inferences, allowing us to set reasonable constraints on the initial metallicity which is, otherwise, unconstrained. This gives an indication of the efficiency of atomic diffusion in the atmospheres of roAp stars and opens the possibility of characterising the transport of chemical elements in their interiors.

"  As a physical and sufficient compression of the full CMB data, the CMB distance priors, or shift parameters, have been widely used and provide a convenient way to include CMB data when obtaining cosmological constraints. In this paper, we revisit this data vector and examine its stability under different cosmological models. We find that the CMB distance priors are an accurate substitute for the full CMB data when probing dark energy dynamics. This is true when the primordial power spectrum model is directly generalized from the power spectrum of the model used in the derivation of the distance priors from the CMB data. We discover a difference when a non-flat model with the untilted primordial inflation power spectrum is used to measure the distance priors. This power spectrum is a radical change from the more conventional tilted primordial power spectrum and violates fundamental assumptions for the reliability of the CMB shift parameters. We also investigate the performance of CMB distance priors when the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\text{eff}}$ are allowed to vary. Our findings are consistent with earlier results: the neutrino parameters can change the measurement of the sound horizon from CMB data, and thus the CMB distance priors. We find that when the neutrino model is allowed to vary, the cold dark matter density $\omega_{c}$ and $N_{\text{eff}}$ need to be included in the set of parameters that summarize CMB data, in order to reproduce the constraints from the full CMB data. We present an updated and expanded set of CMB distance priors which can reproduce constraints from the full CMB data within $1\sigma$, and are applicable to models with massive neutrinos, as well as non-standard cosmologies.

"  For each natural number $n$ we study the modal logic determined by the class of transitive Kripke frames in which there are no cycles of length greater than $n$ and no strictly ascending chains. The case $n=0$ is the G\""odel-L\""ob provability logic. Each logic is axiomatised by adding a single axiom to K4, and is shown to have the finite model property and be decidable.   We then consider a number of extensions of these logics, including restricting to reflexive frames to obtain a corresponding sequence of extensions of S4. When $n=1$, this gives the famous logic of Grzegorczyk, known as S4Grz, which is the strongest modal companion to intuitionistic propositional logic. A topological semantic analysis shows that the $n$-th member of the sequence of extensions of S4 is the logic of hereditarily $n+1$-irresolvable spaces when the modality $\Diamond$ is interpreted as the topological closure operation. We also study the definability of this class of spaces under the interpretation of $\Diamond$ as the derived set (of limit points) operation.   The variety of modal algebras validating the $n$-th logic is shown to be generated by the powerset algebras of the finite frames with cycle length bounded by $n$. Moreover each algebra in the variety is a model of the universal theory of the finite ones, and so is embeddable into an ultraproduct of them. ",mathematics
"  In a quantum mechanical description of the free-electron laser (FEL) the electrons jump on discrete momentum ladders, while they follow continuous trajectories according to the classical description. In order to observe the transition from quantum to classical dynamics, it is not sufficient that many momentum levels are involved. Only if additionally the initial momentum spread of the electron beam is larger than the quantum mechanical recoil, caused by the emission and absorption of photons, the quantum dynamics in phase space resembles the classical one. Beyond these criteria, quantum signatures of averaged quantities like the FEL gain might be washed out. ",quantum physics
"  We discuss the Cauchy problem for a system of semilinear wave equations in three space dimensions with multiple wave speeds. Though our system does not satisfy the standard null condition, we show that it admits a unique global solution for any small and smooth data. This generalizes a preceding result due to Pusateri and Shatah.   The proof is carried out by the energy method involving a collection of generalized derivatives. The multiple wave speeds disable the use of the Lorentz boost operators, and our proof therefore relies upon the version of Klainerman and Sideris. Due to the presence of nonlinear terms violating the standard null condition, some of components of the solution may have a weaker decay as $t\to\infty$, which makes it difficult even to establish a mildly growing (in time) bound for the high energy estimate. We overcome this difficulty by relying upon the ghost weight energy estimate of Alinhac and the Keel-Smith-Sogge type $L^2$ weighted space-time estimate for derivatives. ",mathematics

"  Radar for indoor monitoring is an emerging area of research and development, covering and supporting different health and wellbeing applications of smart homes, assisted living, and medical diagnosis. We report on a successful RF sensing system for home monitoring applications. The system recognizes Activities of Daily Living(ADL) and detects unique motion characteristics, using data processing and training algorithms. We also examine the challenges of continuously monitoring various human activities which can be categorized into translation motions (active mode) and in-place motions (resting mode). We use the range-map, offered by a range-Doppler radar, to obtain the transition time between these two categories, characterized by changing and constant range values, respectively. This is achieved using the Radon transform that identifies straight lines of different slopes in the range-map image. Over the in-place motion time intervals, where activities have insignificant or negligible range swath, power threshold of the radar return micro-Doppler signatures,which is employed to define the time-spans of individual activities with insignificant or negligible range swath. Finding both the transition times and the time-spans of the different motions leads to improved classifications, as it avoids decisions rendered over time windows covering mixed activities.

"  In this paper, we propose a symplectic algorithm for the stable manifolds of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations combined with an iterative procedure in [Sakamoto-van~der Schaft, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 2008]. Our algorithm includes two key aspects. The first one is to prove a precise estimate for radius of convergence and the errors of local approximate stable manifolds. The second one is to extend the local approximate stable manifolds to larger ones by symplectic algorithms which have better long-time behaviors than general-purpose schemes. Our approach avoids the case of divergence of the iterative sequence of approximate stable manifolds, and reduces the computation cost. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by two examples with strong nonlinearities. ",mathematics
"  We derive a continuum mean-curvature flow as a certain hydrodynamic scaling limit of a class of Glauber+Zero-range particle systems. The Zero-range part moves particles while preserving particle numbers, and the Glauber part governs the creation and annihilation of particles and is set to favor two levels of particle density. When the two parts are simultaneously seen in certain different time-scales, the Zero-range part being diffusively scaled while the Glauber part is speeded up at a lesser rate, a mean-curvature interface flow emerges, with a homogenized `surface tension-mobility' parameter reflecting microscopic rates, between the two levels of particle density. We use relative entropy methods, along with a suitable `Boltzmann-Gibbs' principle, to show that the random microscopic system may be approximated by a `discretized' Allen-Cahn PDE with nonlinear diffusion. In turn, we show the behavior of this `discretized' PDE is close to that of a continuum Allen-Cahn equation, whose generation and propagation interface properties we also derive. ",mathematics

This follows from taking full advantage of the space-time localization of caustics in the parametrix we obtain, despite their number increasing like the inverse square root of the distance from the source to the boundary. As a consequence, we improve known Strichartz estimates for the wave equation. Several improvements on our previous parametrix construction are obtained along the way and are of independent interest for further applications. ",mathematics

"  The term radicalization refers to the process of developing extremist religious political or social beliefs and ideologies. Radicalization becomes a threat to national security when it leads to violence. Prevention and de-radicalization initiatives are part of a set of strategies used to combat violent extremism, which taken together are known as Countering Violent Extremism (CVE). Prevention programs aim to stop the radicalization process before it starts. De-radicalization programs attempt to reform convicted extremists with the ultimate goal of social reintegration. We describe prevention and de-radicalization programs mathematically using a compartmental model. The prevention initiatives are modeled by including a vaccination compartment, while the de-radicalization process is modeled by including a treatment compartment. The model exhibits a threshold dynamics characterized by the basic reproduction number $ R _0 $. When $ R _0< 1 $ the system has a unique equilibrium that is asymptotically stable. When $ R _0 >1 $ the system has another equilibrium called ""endemic equilibrium"", which is globally asymptotically stable. These results are established by using Lyapunov functions and LaSalle's invariance principle. We perform numerical simulations to confirm our theoretical results. ",physics

"  The wavelength of undulatory kinematics of fish is an important parameter to determine their hydrodynamic performance. This study focuses on numerical examination of this feature by reconstructing the real physiological model and kinematics of steadily swimmning Jack Fish. We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations for flows over these models composed of the trunk, and dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. Moreover, we prescribe the carangiform-like motion for its undulation for a range of wavelengths. Undulation with larger wavelengths improves the hydrodynamic performance of the carangiform swimmer in terms of better thrust production by the caudal fin, lower drag production on the trunk, and reduced power consumption by the trunk. This coincides with the formation of stronger posterior body vortices and leading-edge vortices with more circulation on the caudal fin. The real kinematics of Jack Fish surpasses the performance of those with prescribed motion owing to the flexibility of the caudal fin. ",physics
"  This paper proposed a distributed filter for spatially interconnected systems (SISs), which considers missing measurements in the sensors of sub-systems. An SIS is established by many similar sub-systems that directly interact or communicate with connective neighbors. Despite that the interactions are simple and tractable, the overall SIS can perform rich and complex behaviors. In actual projects, sensors of sub-systems in a sensor network may break down sometimes, which causes parts of the measurements unavailable unexpectedly. In this work, distributed characteristics of SISs are described by Andrea model and the losses of measurements are assumed to occur with known probabilities. Experimental results confirm that, this filtering method can be effectively employed for the state estimation of SISs, when missing measurements occur. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Under the assumption that the period and the angular velocity of the prescribed rigid-body motion are compatible, and that the mean translational velocity is non-zero, existence of a time-periodic solution is established. The proof is based on an appropriate linearization, which is examined within a setting of absolutely convergent Fourier series. Since the corresponding resolvent problem is ill-posed in classical Sobolev spaces, a linear theory is developed in a framework of homogeneous Sobolev spaces. ",mathematics

"  We investigate how the galaxy reservoirs of molecular gas fuelling star formation are transformed while the host galaxies infall onto galaxy cluster cores. As part of the Spatially Extended ESO Distant Cluster Survey (SEEDisCS), we present CO(3-2) observations of 27 star-forming galaxies obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). These sources are located inside and around CL1411.1$-$1148 at $z=0.5195$, within five times the cluster virial radius. These targets were selected to have stellar masses M$_{\rm star}$), colours, and magnitudes similar to those of a field comparison sample at similar redshift drawn from the Plateau de Bure high-$z$ Blue Sequence Survey (PHIBSS2). We compare the cold gas fraction ($\mu_{\rm H_2}=$ M$_{\rm H_2}$/M$_{\rm star}$), specific star formation rates (SFR/M$_{\rm star}$) and depletion timescales ($t_{\rm depl}=$ M$_{\rm H_2}$/SFR) of our main-sequence galaxies to the PHIBSS2 subsample. While the most of our galaxies (63\%) are consistent with PHIBSS2, the remainder fall below the relation between $\mu_\mathrm{H_2}$ and M$_{\rm star}$ of the PHIBSS2 galaxies at $z\sim0.5$. These low-$\mu_\mathrm{H_2}$ galaxies are not compatible with the tail of a Gaussian distribution, hence they correspond to a new population of galaxies with normal SFRs but low gas content and low depletion times ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr), absent from previous surveys. We suggest that the star formation activity of these galaxies has not yet been diminished by their low fraction of cold molecular gas. ",astrophysics

"  One of the most elusive problems in quantum mechanics is the transition between classical and quantum physics. This problem can be traced back to the Schr\""{o}dinger's cat. A key element that lies at the center of this problem is the lack of a clear understanding and characterization of macroscopic quantum states. Our understanding of Macroscopic Quantumness relies on states such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) or the NOON state. Here we take a first principle approach to this problem. We start from coherence as the key quantity that captures the notion of quantumness and demand the quantumness to be collective and macroscopic. To this end, we introduce macroscopic coherence which is the coherence between macroscopically distinct quantum states. We construct a measure that quantifies how global and collective the coherence of the state is. Our work also provides a first-principle way to derive well-established states like the GHZ and the NOON state as the states that maximize our measure. This new approach paves the way towards a better understanding of the Quantum-to-Classical transition. ",quantum physics

"  We consider the $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, whose topological sectors are restricted to the instanton number with integer multiples of $p$. We can formulate such a quantum field theory maintaining locality and unitarity, and the model contains both $2\pi$-periodic scalar and $3$-form gauge fields. This can be interpreted as coupling a topological theory to Yang-Mills theory, so the local dynamics becomes identical with that of pure Yang-Mills theory. The theory has not only $\mathbb{Z}_N$ $1$-form symmetry but also $\mathbb{Z}_p$ $3$-form symmetry, and we study the global nature of this theory from the recent 't Hooft anomaly matching. The computation of 't Hooft anomaly incorporates an intriguing higher-group structure. We also carefully examine that how such kinematical constraint is realized in the dynamics by using the large-$N$ and also the reliable semiclassics on $\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$, and we find that the topological susceptibility plays a role of the order parameter for the $\mathbb{Z}_p$ $3$-form symmetry. Introducing a fermion in the fundamental or adjoint representation, we find that the chiral symmetry becomes larger than the usual case by $\mathbb{Z}_p$, and it leads to the extra $p$ vacua by discrete chiral symmetry breaking. No dynamical domain wall can interpolate those extra vacua since such objects must be charged under the $3$-form symmetry in order to match the 't Hooft anomaly. ",high energy physics theory
"  In this paper, we investigate steady inviscid compressible flows with radial symmetry in an annulus. The major concerns are transonic flows with or without shocks. One of the main motivations is to elucidate the role played by the angular velocity in the structure of steady inviscid compressible flows. We give a complete classification of flow patterns in terms of boundary conditions at the inner and outer circle. Due to the nonzero angular velocity, many new flow patterns will appear. There exists accelerating or decelerating smooth transonic flows in an annulus satisfying one side boundary conditions at the inner or outer circle with all sonic points being nonexceptional and noncharacteristically degenerate. More importantly, it is found that besides the well-known supersonic-subsonic shock in a divergent nozzle as in the case without angular velocity, there exists a supersonic-supersonic shock solution, where the downstream state may change smoothly from supersonic to subsonic. Furthermore, there exists a supersonic-sonic shock solution where the shock circle and the sonic circle coincide, which is new and interesting. ",mathematics
"  We analyze the strong noise limit of one-dimensional stochastic differential equations (SDEs).   Our initial motivation comes from continuous measurements of open quantum systems.

As the noise grows larger, the solutions exhibit locally a collapsing, that is to say, converge to pure jump processes very reminiscent of a metastability phenomenon. But surprisingly the limiting jump process is decorated by a spike process.   We give a precise meaning to the convergence and completely prove these statements for a large class of one-dimensional diffusions, thanks to a robust strategy of proof. ",mathematics

"  In 2013, Balasubramanian presented a 5+1 dimensional holographic toy model that allows for an exact solution to Einstein's equations in the bulk in which the isometries of $AdS_5$ appear to be broken to an isometry group describing a discretely scale invariant and Poincar\'e invariant setup [arXiv:1301.6653]. In this paper, we investigate this solution in more detail. By analytically solving the Killing equations, we prove that the full $AdS_5$ isometry group is still present, although in a somewhat hidden way. We will also comment on the prospects of finding other holographic bottom up toy models which allow for solutions with discrete scale invariance or scale invariance without conformal invariance in the future.

"  The $Golomb$ $space$ (resp. the $Kirch$ $space$) is the set $\mathbb N$ of positive integers endowed with the topology generated by the base consisting of arithmetic progressions $a+b\mathbb N_0=\{a+bn:n\ge 0\}$ where $a\in\mathbb N$ and $b$ is a (square-free) number, coprime with $a$. It is known that the Golomb space (resp. the Kirch space) is connected (and locally connected). By a recent result of Banakh, Spirito and Turek, the Golomb space has trivial homeomorphism group and hence is topologically rigid. In this paper we prove the topological rigidity of the Kirch space.

"  While numerical simulations have been playing a key role in the studies of planet-disk interaction, testing numerical results against observations has been limited so far. With the two directly imaged protoplanets embedded in its circumstellar disk, PDS 70 offers an ideal testbed for planet-disk interaction studies. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations we show that the observed features can be well explained with the two planets in formation, providing strong evidence that previously proposed theories of planet-disk interaction are in action, including resonant migration, particle trapping, size segregation, and filtration. Our simulations suggest that the two planets are likely in 2:1 mean motion resonance and can remain dynamically stable over million-year timescales. The growth of the planets at $10^{-8}-10^{-7}~M_{\rm Jup}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, rates comparable to the estimates from H$\alpha$ observations, does not destabilize the resonant configuration. Large grains are filtered at the gap edge and only small, (sub-)$\mu$m grains can flow to the circumplanetary disks and the inner circumstellar disk. With the sub-millimeter continuum ring observed outward of the two directly imaged planets, PDS 70 provides the first observational evidence of particle filtration by gap-opening planets. The observed sub-millimeter continuum emission at the vicinity of the planets can be reproduced when (sub-)$\mu$m grains survive over multiple circumplanetary disk gas viscous timescales and accumulate therein. One such possibility is if (sub-)$\mu$m grains grow in size and remain trapped in pressure bumps, similar to what we find happening in circumstellar disks. We discuss potential implications to planet formation in the solar system and mature extrasolar planetary systems. ",astrophysics
"  The local polarization of electromagnetic (EMW) and gravitational waves (GW) is discussed from an operational point of view, in which all the relevant mathematical framework is constructed in terms of measurements of the power absorbed by a local detector. The intrinsic dependence of the observations upon the nature of the detector is emphasized. In particular, the benefit of using a dual-symmetric detector, equally sensitive to the electric and magnetic fields of the EMW (resp. gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic tensor in the GW case) is pointed out. The Majorana stellar representation of the polarization is introduced, and its physical interpretation is highlighted. Finally, expressions for the energy density, linear momentum density, helicity and spin density of the wave in terms of the Majorana representation are presented. ",physics
"  It is currently believed that the turbulent fluctuations pervade the outermost heliosphere. Turbulence, magnetic reconnection, and their link may be responsible for magnetic energy conversion in these regions. The governing mechanisms of such anisotropic and compressible magnetic turbulence in the inner heliosheath (IHS) and in the local interstellar medium (LISM) still lack a thorough description. The present literature mainly concerns large scales which are not representative of the inertial-cascade dynamics of turbulence. Moreover, lack of broadband spectral analysis makes the IHS dynamics critically understudied. Our recent study shows that 48 s magnetic-field data from the Voyager mission are appropriate for a spectral analysis over a frequency range of six decades, from 5 x 10-8 Hz to 10-2 Hz. Here, focusing on the Voyager 2 observation interval from 2013.824 to 2016.0, we describe the structure of turbulence in a sector zone of the IHS. A spectral break around 7 x 10-7 Hz (magnetic structures with size l~1.3 Astronomical Units) separates the energy-injection regime from the inertial-cascade regime of turbulence. A second scale is observed around 6 x 10-5 Hz (l~ 0.017 AU) and corresponds to a peak of compressibility and intermittency of fluctuations. ",physics
"  This paper proposes a novel label-synchronous speech-to-text alignment technique for automatic speech recognition (ASR). The speech-to-text alignment is a problem of splitting long audio recordings with un-aligned transcripts into utterance-wise pairs of speech and text. Unlike conventional methods based on frame-synchronous prediction, the proposed method re-defines the speech-to-text alignment as a label-synchronous text mapping problem. This enables an accurate alignment benefiting from the strong inference ability of the state-of-the-art attention-based encoder-decoder models, which cannot be applied to the conventional methods. Two different Transformer models named forward Transformer and backward Transformer are respectively used for estimating an initial and final tokens of a given speech segment based on end-of-sentence prediction with teacher-forcing. Experiments using the corpus of spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) demonstrate that the proposed method provides an accurate utterance-wise alignment, that matches the manually annotated alignment with as few as 0.2% errors. It is also confirmed that a Transformer-based hybrid CTC/Attention ASR model using the aligned speech and text pairs as an additional training data reduces character error rates relatively up to 59.0%, which is significantly better than 39.0% reduction by a conventional alignment method based on connectionist temporal classification model.

"  Automatic cell segmentation is an essential step in the pipeline of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), such as the detection and grading of breast cancer. Accurate segmentation of cells can not only assist the pathologists to make a more precise diagnosis, but also save much time and labor. However, this task suffers from stain variation, cell inhomogeneous intensities, background clutters and cells from different tissues. To address these issues, we propose an Attention Enforced Network (AENet), which is built on spatial attention module and channel attention module, to integrate local features with global dependencies and weight effective channels adaptively. Besides, we introduce a feature fusion branch to bridge high-level and low-level features. Finally, the marker controlled watershed algorithm is applied to post-process the predicted segmentation maps for reducing the fragmented regions. In the test stage, we present an individual color normalization method to deal with the stain variation problem. We evaluate this model on the MoNuSeg dataset. The quantitative comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our approach. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  We present an efficient implementation of periodic Gaussian density fitting (GDF) using the Coulomb metric. The three-center integrals are divided into two parts by range-separating the Coulomb kernel, with the short-range part evaluated in real space and the long-range part in reciprocal space. With a few algorithmic optimizations, we show that this new method -- which we call range-separated GDF (RSGDF) -- scales sublinearly to linearly with the number of $k$-points for small to medium-sized $k$-point meshes that are commonly used in periodic calculations with electron correlation. Numerical results on a few three-dimensional solids show about $10$-fold speedups over the previously developed GDF with little precision loss. The error introduced by RSGDF is about $10^{-5}~E_{\textrm{h}}$ in the converged Hartree-Fock energy with default auxiliary basis sets and can be systematically reduced by increasing the size of the auxiliary basis with little extra work.

"  AU Mic is a young, very active M dwarf star with a debris disk and at least one transiting Neptune-size planet. Here we present detailed analysis of the magnetic field of AU Mic based on previously unpublished high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectropolarimetric observations. We report a systematic detection of circular and linear polarization signatures in the stellar photospheric lines. Tentative Zeeman Doppler imaging modeling of the former data suggests a non-axisymmetric global field with a surface-averaged strength of about 90 G. At the same time, linear polarization observations indicate the presence of a much stronger $\approx$2 kG axisymmetric dipolar field, which contributes no circular polarization signal due to the equator-on orientation of AU Mic. A separate Zeeman broadening and intensification analysis allowed us to determine a mean field modulus of 2.3 and 2.1 kG from the Y- and K-band atomic lines respectively. These magnetic field measurements are essential for understanding environmental conditions within the AU Mic planetary system. ",astrophysics
"  Deep learning in gastrointestinal endoscopy can assist to improve clinical performance and be helpful to assess lesions more accurately. To this extent, semantic segmentation methods that can perform automated real-time delineation of a region-of-interest, e.g., boundary identification of cancer or precancerous lesions, can benefit both diagnosis and interventions. However, accurate and real-time segmentation of endoscopic images is extremely challenging due to its high operator dependence and high-definition image quality. To utilize automated methods in clinical settings, it is crucial to design lightweight models with low latency such that they can be integrated with low-end endoscope hardware devices. In this work, we propose NanoNet, a novel architecture for the segmentation of video capsule endoscopy and colonoscopy images. Our proposed architecture allows real-time performance and has higher segmentation accuracy compared to other more complex ones. We use video capsule endoscopy and standard colonoscopy datasets with polyps, and a dataset consisting of endoscopy biopsies and surgical instruments, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Our experiments demonstrate the increased performance of our architecture in terms of a trade-off between model complexity, speed, model parameters, and metric performances. Moreover, the resulting model size is relatively tiny, with only nearly 36,000 parameters compared to traditional deep learning approaches having millions of parameters.

"  When providing bulk power system services, a third-party aggregator could inadvertently cause operational issues at the distribution level. We propose a coordination architecture in which an aggregator and distribution operator coordinate to avoid distribution network constraint violations, while preserving private information. The aggregator controls thermostatic loads to provide frequency regulation, while the distribution operator overrides the aggregator's control actions when necessary to ensure safe network operation. Using this architecture, we propose two control strategies, which differ in terms of measurement and communication requirements, as well as model complexity and scalability. The first uses an aggregate model and blocking controller, while the second uses individual load models and a mode-count controller. Both outperform a benchmark strategy in terms of tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the second strategy performs better than the first, with only 0.10% average RMS error (compared to 0.70%). The second is also able to maintain safe operation of the distribution network while overriding less than 1% of the aggregator's control actions (compared to approximately 15% by the first strategy). However, the second strategy has significantly more measurement, communication, and computational requirements, and therefore would be more complex and expensive to implement than the first strategy.

"  The conformal bridge transformation (CBT) is reviewed in the light of the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Originally, the CBT was presented as a non-unitary transformation (a complex canonical transformation in the classical case) that relates two different forms of dynamics in the sense of Dirac. Namely, it maps the asymptotically free form into the harmonically confined form of dynamics associated with the $\mathfrak{so}(2,1)\cong \mathfrak{sl}(2,{\mathbb R})$ conformal symmetry. However, as the transformation relates the non-Hermitian operator $i\hat{D}$, where $\hat{D}$ is the generator of dilations, with the compact Hermitian generator $\hat{\mathcal{J}}_0$ of the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,{\mathbb R})$ algebra, the CBT generator can be associated with a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric metric. In this work we review the applications of this transformation for one- and two-dimensional systems, as well as for systems on a cosmic string background, and for a conformally extended charged particle in the field of Dirac monopole. We also compare and unify the CBT with the Darboux transformation. The latter is used to construct $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric solutions of the equations of the KdV hierarchy with the properties of extreme waves. As a new result, by using a modified CBT we relate the one-dimensional $\mathcal{PT}$-regularized asymptotically free conformal mechanics model with the $\mathcal{PT}$-regularized version of the de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan system.

"  The Schrodinger equation for a macroscopic number of particles is linear in the wave function, deterministic, and invariant under time reversal. In contrast, the concepts used and calculations done in statistical physics and condensed matter physics involve stochasticity, nonlinearities, irreversibility, top-down effects, and elements from classical physics. This paper analyzes several methods used in condensed matter physics and statistical physics and explains how they are in fundamental ways incompatible with the above properties of the Schrodinger equation. The problems posed by reconciling these approaches to unitary quantum mechanics are of a similar type as the quantum measurement problem. This paper therefore argues that rather than aiming at reconciling these contrasts one should use them to identify the limits of quantum mechanics. The thermal wave length and thermal time indicate where these limits are for (quasi-)particles that constitute the thermal degrees of freedom. ",quantum physics

"  Nanowires can serve as flexible substrates for hybrid epitaxial growth on selected facets, allowing for design of heterostructures with complex material combinations and geometries.

We study the crystal growth and complex epitaxial matching of wurtzite InAs / rock-salt EuS interfaces as well as rock-salt EuS / face-centered cubic Al interfaces. Because of the magnetic anisotropy originating from the nanowire shape, the magnetic structure of the EuS phase are easily tuned into single magnetic domains. This effect efficiently ejects the stray field lines along the nanowires. With tunnel spectroscopy measurements of the density of states, we show the material has a hard induced superconducting gap, and magnetic hysteretic evolution which indicates that the magnetic exchange fields are not negligible. These hybrid nanowires fulfil key material requirements for serving as a platform for spin-based quantum applications, such as scalable topological quantum computing. ",quantum physics
"  We systematically study the perturbative anomaly inflow by the bulk Chern-Simons (CS) theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime ($\text{AdS}_5$). When the bulk geometry is chosen to be AdS, along with the standard bulk-boundary interplay, an additional, holographic dual description emerges. Introduction of UV and IR 3-branes makes the anomaly story remarkably rich and many interesting aspects can be obtained. With Neumann boundary conditions (BC) on the IR brane, the dual CFT has an unbroken symmetry, which then can either be weakly gauged by choosing Neumann UV-BC, or kept as a purely global symmetry with Dirichlet UV-BC. This corresponds to the holographic realization of `t Hooft anomaly matching, either for ABJ or `t Hooft anomalies, or both. On the other hand, when the IR-BC breaks the bulk gauge group $G$ down to a subgroup $H_1$, the dual 4D CFT has a spontaneously broken symmetry. In this case, we describe how the (gauged) Wess-Zumino-Witten action emerges naturally from the bulk CS action. In particular, we discuss that, unlike in the case of Neumann IR-BC where 5D gauge invariance is restored by IR brane-localized fermions, with $G/H_1$ IR-BC no localized modes are required. Nevertheless, anomaly matching is fulfilled by delocalized modes, namely Wilson lines along the fifth dimension, and these are Goldstone bosons (GB) in the dual 4D theory. When some part of $G$ is weakly gauged we show that, thanks to a proper field redefinition of the corresponding source fields, the ""would-be"" GBs can be completely removed, consistently with our standard expectation. We demonstrate how the most general case, a typical situation occurring in models of dynamical symmetry breaking, may be analyzed with our formalism. Finally, we discuss the quantization condition of the CS level, both with Neumann and Dirichlet BC. ",high energy physics theory
"  We introduce the concept of a Graph-Informed Neural Network (GINN), a hybrid approach combining deep learning with probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) that acts as a surrogate for physics-based representations of multiscale and multiphysics systems. GINNs address the twin challenges of removing intrinsic computational bottlenecks in physics-based models and generating large data sets for estimating probability distributions of quantities of interest (QoIs) with a high degree of confidence. Both the selection of the complex physics learned by the NN and its supervised learning/prediction are informed by the PGM, which includes the formulation of structured priors for tunable control variables (CVs) to account for their mutual correlations and ensure physically sound CV and QoI distributions. GINNs accelerate the prediction of QoIs essential for simulation-based decision-making where generating sufficient sample data using physics-based models alone is often prohibitively expensive. Using a real-world application grounded in supercapacitor-based energy storage, we describe the construction of GINNs from a Bayesian network-embedded homogenized model for supercapacitor dynamics, and demonstrate their ability to produce kernel density estimates of relevant non-Gaussian, skewed QoIs with tight confidence intervals.

Following this discussion, numerical results on the excitation of interfacial waves in two-layer liquid metal systems with miscibility gaps bearing an interface normal electric current are presented. Confirming recent results from the literature, we find that magnetic damping plays a decisive role for strong vertical magnetic fields. In addition, boundary conditions for the electric field strongly influence critical currents and growth rates. ",physics

"  Speech encodes a wealth of information related to human behavior and has been used in a variety of automated behavior recognition tasks. However, extracting behavioral information from speech remains challenging including due to inadequate training data resources stemming from the often low occurrence frequencies of specific behavioral patterns. Moreover, supervised behavioral modeling typically relies on domain-specific construct definitions and corresponding manually-annotated data, rendering generalizing across domains challenging. In this paper, we exploit the stationary properties of human behavior within an interaction and present a representation learning method to capture behavioral information from speech in an unsupervised way. We hypothesize that nearby segments of speech share the same behavioral context and hence map onto similar underlying behavioral representations. We present an encoder-decoder based Deep Contextualized Network (DCN) as well as a Triplet-Enhanced DCN (TE-DCN) framework to capture the behavioral context and derive a manifold representation, where speech frames with similar behaviors are closer while frames of different behaviors maintain larger distances. The models are trained on movie audio data and validated on diverse domains including on a couples therapy corpus and other publicly collected data (e.g., stand-up comedy). With encouraging results, our proposed framework shows the feasibility of unsupervised learning within cross-domain behavioral modeling. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  This paper studies the $J$-method of [E. Jarlebring, S. Kvaal, W. Michiels. SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 36-4:A1978-A2001, 2014] for nonlinear eigenvector problems in a general Hilbert space framework. This is the basis for variational discretization techniques and a mesh-independent numerical analysis. A simple modification of the method mimics an energy-decreasing discrete gradient flow. In the case of the Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem, we prove global convergence towards an eigenfunction for a damped version of the $J$-method. More importantly, when the iterations are sufficiently close to an eigenfunction, the damping can be switched off and we recover a local linear convergence rate previously known from the discrete setting. This quantitative convergence analysis is closely connected to the~$J$-method's unique feature of sensitivity with respect to spectral shifts. Contrary to classical gradient flows, this allows both the selective approximation of excited states as well as the amplification of convergence beyond linear rates in the spirit of the Rayleigh quotient iteration for linear eigenvalue problems. These advantageous convergence properties are demonstrated in a series of numerical experiments involving exponentially localized states under disorder potentials and vortex lattices in rotating traps.

Here we demonstrate a natural upgrading of Poisson-Lie to the context of M-theory using the tools of exceptional field theory. In particular, we propose how the underlying idea of a Drinfeld double can be generalised to an algebra we call an exceptional Drinfeld algebra. These admit a notion of ""maximally isotropic subalgebras"" and we show how to define a generalised Scherk-Schwarz truncation on the associated group manifold to such a subalgebra. This allows us to define a notion of Poisson-Lie U-duality. Moreover, the closure conditions of the exceptional Drinfeld algebra define natural analogues of the cocycle and co-Jacobi conditions arising in Drinfeld double. We show that upon making a further coboundary restriction to the cocycle that an M-theoretic extension of Yang-Baxter deformations arise. We remark on the application of this construction as a solution-generating technique within supergravity. ",high energy physics theory
"  Exceptional theories are a group of one-parameter scalar field theories with (enhanced) vanishing soft limits in the S-matrix elements.

Such an approach was first applied to NLSM in 1709.08639 and 1804.08629, and here we use it to systematically study other exceptional scalar field theories. In particular, using the subleading single soft theorem for the special Galileon we identify the Feynman vertices of the corresponding extended theory, which was first discovered using the Cachazo-He-Yuan representation of scattering amplitudes.

"  Recently, a coherent picture of the quantum mechanics of an evaporating black hole has been presented which reconciles unitarity with the predictions of the equivalence principle. The thermal nature of a black hole as viewed in a distant reference frame arises from entanglement between the hard and soft modes, generated by the chaotic dynamics at the string scale. In this paper, we elaborate on this picture, particularly emphasizing the importance of the chaotic nature of the string (UV) dynamics across all low energy species in generating large (IR) spacetime behind the horizon. Implications of this UV/IR relation include O(1) breaking of global symmetries at the string scale and a self-repair mechanism of black holes restoring the smoothness of their horizons. We also generalize the framework to other systems, including Rindler, de Sitter, and asymptotically flat spacetimes, and find a consistent picture in each case. Finally, we discuss the origin of the particular construction adopted in describing the black hole interior as well as the outside of a de Sitter horizon. We argue that the construction is selected by the quantum-to-classical transition, in particular the applicability of the Born rule in a quantum mechanical world. ",high energy physics theory

The bounds depend on two parameters which for reasonable estimates restrict the tensor-to-scalar ratio to be within reach of future surveys. ",high energy physics theory
"  Probabilistic optimal power flow (POPF) is an important analytical tool to ensure the secure and economic operation of power systems. POPF needs to solve enormous nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems. The huge computational burden has become the major bottleneck for the practical application. This paper presents a deep learning approach to solve the POPF problem efficiently and accurately. Taking advantage of the deep structure and reconstructive strategy of stacked denoising auto encoders (SDAE), a SDAE-based optimal power flow (OPF) is developed to extract the high-level nonlinear correlations between the system operating condition and the OPF solution. A training process is designed to learn the feature of POPF. The trained SDAE network can be utilized to conveniently calculate the OPF solution of random samples generated by Monte-Carlo simulation (MCS) without the need of optimization. A modified IEEE 118-bus power system is simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We study the existence and stability of standing pulse solutions to a singularly perturbed three-component reaction diffusion system with one-activator and two-inhibitor type. We apply the MAE (matched asymptotic expansion) method to the construction of solutions and the SLEP (Singular Limit Eigenvalue Problem) method to their stability properties. This approach is not just an alternative approach to geometric singular perturbation and the associated Evans function, but gives us two advantages: one is the extendability to higher dimensional case, and the other is to allow us to obtain more precise information on the behaviors of critical eigenvalues. This implies the existence of codimension two singularity of drift and Hopf bifurcations for the standing pulse solution and it is numerically confirmed that stable standing and traveling breathers emerge around the singularity in a physically-acceptable regime.

"  We consider both the internal and boundary controllability problems for wave equations under non-negativity constraints on the controls. First, we prove the steady state controllability property with nonnegative controls for a general class of wave equations with time-independent coefficients. According to it, the system can be driven from a steady state generated by a strictly positive control to another, by means of nonnegative controls, when the time of control is long enough. Secondly, under the added assumption of conservation and coercivity of the energy, controllability is proved between states lying on two distinct trajectories. Our methods are described and developed in an abstract setting, to be applicable to a wide variety of control systems. ",mathematics

"  We propose a three-track detection system for two dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) in which a local area influence probabilistic (LAIP) detector works with a trellis-based Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) detector to remove intersymbol interference (ISI) and intertrack interference (ITI) among coded data bits as well as media noise due to magnetic grain-bit interactions. Two minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) linear equalizers with different response targets are employed before the LAIP and BCJR detectors. The LAIP detector considers local grain-bit interactions and passes coded bit log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) to the channel decoder, whose output LLRs serve as a priori information to the BCJR detector, which is followed by a second channel decoding pass. Simulation results under 1-shot decoding on a grain-flipping-probability (GFP) media model show that the proposed LAIP/BCJR detection system achieves density gains of 6.8% for center-track detection and 1.2% for three-track detection compared to a standard BCJR/1D-PDNP. The proposed system's BCJR detector bit error rates (BERs) are lower than those of a recently proposed two-track BCJR/2D-PDNP system by factors of (0.55, 0.08) for tracks 1 and 2 respectively.

"  The original de Rham cohomology due to Souriau and the singular cohomology in diffeology are not isomorphic to each other in general. This manuscript introduces a singular de Rham complex endowed with an integration map into the singular cochain complex which gives the de Rham theorem for every diffeological space. It is also proved that a morphism called the factor map from the original de Rham complex to the new one is a quasi-isomorphism for a manifold and, more general, a space with singularities. Moreover, Chen's iterated integrals are considered in a diffeological framework. As a consequence, we deduce that the bar complex of the original de Rham complex of a simply-connected diffeological space is quasi-isomorphic to the singular de Rham complex of the diffeological free loop space provided the factor map for the underlying diffeological space is a quasi-isomorphism. The process for proving the assertion yields the Leray--Serre spectral sequence and the Eilenberg--Moore spectral sequence in diffeology. ",mathematics
"  We study energy minimization of a continuum Landau-de Gennes energy functional for nematic liquid crystals, in three-dimensional axisymmetric domains and in a restricted class of $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant (i.e., axially symmetric) configurations. We assume smooth and nonvanishing $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant (e.g. homeotropic) Dirichlet boundary conditions and a physically relevant norm constraint (Lyuksyutov constraint) in the interior. Relying on results in \cite{DMP1} in the nonsymmetric setting, we prove partial regularity of minimizers away from a possible finite set of interior singularities lying on the symmetry axis. For a suitable class of domains and boundary data we show that for smooth minimizers (torus solutions) the level sets of the signed biaxiality are generically finite union of tori of revolution. Concerning nonsmooth minimizers (split solutions), we characterize their asymptotic behavior around any singular point in terms of explicit $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant harmonic maps into $\mathbb{S}^4$, whence the generic level sets of the signed biaxiality contains invariant topological spheres. Finally, in the model case of a nematic droplet, we provide existence of torus solutions, at least when the boundary data are suitable uniaxial deformations of the radial anchoring, and existence of split solutions for boundary data which are suitable linearly full harmonic spheres.

"  We present spectroscopy and orbital periods Porb for 30 apparently non-magnetic cataclysmic binaries with periods below about 3 hours, nearly all of which are dwarf novae, mostly of the SU Ursae Majoris subclass. We then turn to the evidence supporting the prediction that short-period dwarf novae evolve toward longer periods after passing through a minimum period -- the ""period bounce"" phenomenon. Plotting data from the literature reveals that for superhump period excess $\epsilon = (P_{\rm sh} - P_{\rm orb} )/P_{\rm orb}$ below about 0.015, the period appears to increase with decreasing epsilon, agreeing at least qualitatively with the predicted behavior. Next, motivated by the long (decadal) outburst intervals of the WZ Sagittae subclass of short-period dwarf novae, we ask whether there could be a sizable population of ""lurkers"" -- systems that resemble dwarf novae at minimum light, but do not outburst over accessible timescales (or at all), and therefore do not draw attention to themselves. By examining the outburst history of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample of CVs, which were selected by color and not by outburst, we find that a large majority of the color-selected dwarf-nova-like objects have been observed to outburst, and conclude that ""lurkers"", if they exist, are a relatively minor part of the CV population.

"  We consider stochastic optimization problems which use observed data to estimate essential characteristics of the random quantities involved. Sample average approximation (SAA) or empirical (plug-in) estimation are very popular ways to use data in optimization. It is well known that sample average optimization suffers from downward bias. We propose to use smooth estimators rather than empirical ones in optimization problems. We establish consistency results for the optimal value and the set of optimal solutions of the new problem formulation. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to SAA theoretically and numerically. We analyze the bias of the new problems and identify sufficient conditions for ensuring less biased estimation of the optimal value of the true problem. At the same time, the error of the new estimator remains controlled. We show that those conditions are satisfied for many popular statistical problems such as regression models, classification problems, and optimization problems with Average (Conditional) Value-at-Risk. We have observed that smoothing the least-squares objective in a regression problem by a normal kernel leads to a ridge regression. Our numerical experience shows that the new estimators frequently exhibit also smaller variance and smaller mean-square error than those of SAA. ",mathematics

The talk will give an introduction into the mathematics behind them, covering the topics of elliptic curves, elliptic integrals, modular forms and the moduli space of $n$ marked points on a genus one curve. The latter will be important, as elliptic Feynman integrals can be expressed as iterated integrals on the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_{1,n}$, in same way as Feynman integrals which evaluate to multiple polylogarithms can be expressed as iterated integrals on the moduli space ${\mathcal M}_{0,n}$. With the right language, many methods from the genus zero case carry over to the genus one case. In particular we will see in specific examples that the differential equation for elliptic Feynman integrals can be cast into an $\varepsilon$-form. This allows to systematically obtain a solution order by order in the dimensional regularisation parameter. ",high energy physics theory
"  Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part. ",physics
"  Shadowing methods compute derivatives of averaged objectives of chaos with respect to parameters of the dynamical system. However, previous convergence proofs of shadowing methods wrongly assume that shadowing trajectories are representative. In contrast, the linear response formula is proved rigorously, but is more difficult to compute.   In this paper, we first prove that the shadowing method computes a part of the linear response formula, which we call the shadowing contribution. Then we show that the error of shadowing is typically small for systems with small ratio of unstable directions. For partly reducing this error, we give a correction which can be easily implemented. Finally, we prove the convergence of the non-intrusive shadowing, the fastest shadowing algorithm, to the shadowing contribution. ",mathematics
"  This work investigates the problem of analyzing privacy for general Markov processes. These processes may be affected by changes, or exogenous signals, that need to remain private. Privacy refers to the disclosure of information of these changes through observations of the underlying Markov chain. In contrast to previous work on privacy, we study the problem for an online sequence of data. We use theoretical tools from optimal detection theory to motivate a definition of online privacy based on the average amount of information per observation of the stochastic system in consideration. Two cases are considered: the full-information case, where the eavesdropper measures all but the signals that indicate a change, and the limited-information case, where the eavesdropper only measures the state of the Markov process. For both cases, we provide ways to derive privacy upper-bounds and compute policies that attain a higher privacy level. It turns out that the problem of computing privacy-aware policies is concave, and we conclude with some examples and numerical simulations for both cases. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We investigate the entanglement entropy of a two-dimensional disordered system holographically. In particular, we study the evolution of the entanglement entropy along renormalization group flows for a conformal theory at the UV fixed point, that is perturbed by weak disorder into a Lifshitz theory at the IR fixed point. Through numerical fitting, we find that the disorder correlations leads to a sub-leading power-law term in the entanglement entropy that vanishes at the IR fixed point. Interestingly, the exponent that controls the power-law vanishing of the sub-leading term seems to be almost universal as it depends very weakly on the strength of the disorder. We show that our results can be put in the context of the c-theorem by defining an effective central charge that decreases along the RG flow. We also investigate disorder induced long-range correlations between the two subsystems by studying the holographic mutual information. ",high energy physics theory
"  Meibography is a non-contact imaging technique used by ophthalmologists to assist in the evaluation and diagnosis of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). While artificial qualitative analysis of meibography images could lead to low repeatability and efficiency and multi-parametric analysis is demanding to offer more comprehensive information in discovering subtle changes of meibomian glands during MGD progression, we developed an automated and multi-parametric algorithm for objective and quantitative analysis of meibography images. The full architecture of the algorithm can be divided into three steps: (1) segmentation of the tarsal conjunctiva area as the region of interest (ROI); (2) segmentation and identification of glands within the ROI; and (3) quantitative multi-parametric analysis including newly defined gland diameter deformation index (DI), gland tortuosity index (TI), and glands signal index (SI). To evaluate the performance of the automated algorithm, the similarity index (k) and the segmentation error including the false positive rate (r_P) and the false negative rate (r_N) are calculated between the manually defined ground truth and the automatic segmentations of both the ROI and meibomian glands of 15 typical meibography images. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated in analyzing typical meibograhy images. ",electrical engineering and systems science

The inverse scattering problem aims to determine the shape of bi-anisotropic periodic scatterers from electromagnetic near field data at a fixed frequency. The Factorization method is studied as an analytical and numerical tool for solving the inverse problem. We provide a rigorous justification of the Factorization method which results in the unique determination and a fast imaging algorithm for the periodic scatterer. Numerical examples for imaging three-dimensional periodic structures are presented to examine the efficiency of the method. ,mathematics
"  While Robust Model Predictive Control considers the worst-case system uncertainty, Stochastic Model Predictive Control, using chance constraints, provides less conservative solutions by allowing a certain constraint violation probability depending on a predefined risk parameter. However, for safety-critical systems it is not only important to bound the constraint violation probability but to reduce this probability as much as possible. Therefore, an approach is necessary that minimizes the constraint violation probability while ensuring that the Model Predictive Control optimization problem remains feasible. We propose a novel Model Predictive Control scheme that yields a solution with minimal constraint violation probability for a norm constraint in an environment with uncertainty. After minimal constraint violation is guaranteed the solution is then also optimized with respect to other control objectives. Further, it is possible to account for changes over time of the support of the uncertainty. We first present a general method and then provide an approach for uncertainties with symmetric, unimodal probability density function. Recursive feasibility and convergence of the method are proved. A simulation example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  Asymptotic multiple scale homogenisation allows to determine the effective behaviour of a porous medium by starting from the pore-scale description, when there is a large separation between the pore-scale and the macroscopic scale. When the scale ratio is ""small but not too small,"" the standard approach based on first-order homogenisation may break down since additional terms need to be taken into account in order to obtain an accurate picture of the overall response of the medium. The effect of low scale separation can be obtained by exploiting higher order equations in the asymptotic homogenisation procedure. The aim of the present study is to investigate higher-order terms up to the third order of the advective-diffusive model to describe advection-diffusion in a macroscopically homogeneous porous medium at low scale separation. The main result of the study is that the low separation of scales induces dispersion effects. In particular, the second-order model is similar to the most currently used phenomenological model of dispersion: it is characacterized by a dispersion tensor which can be decomposed into a purely diffusive component and a mechanical dispersion part, whilst this property is not verifed in the homogenised dispersion model (obtained at higher P\'eclet number). The third-order description contains second and third concentration gradient terms, with a fourth order tensor of diffusion and with a third-order and an additional second-order tensors of dispersion. The analysis of the macroscopic fluxes shows that the second and the third order macroscopic fluxes are distinct from the volume means of the corresponding local fluxes and allows to determine expressions of the non-local effects.

"  We present a method for supervised learning of sparsity-promoting regularizers for image denoising. Sparsity-promoting regularization is a key ingredient in solving modern image reconstruction problems; however, the operators underlying these regularizers are usually either designed by hand or learned from data in an unsupervised way. The recent success of supervised learning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in solving image reconstruction problems suggests that it could be a fruitful approach to designing regularizers. As a first experiment in this direction, we propose to denoise images using a variational formulation with a parametric, sparsity-promoting regularizer, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize the mean squared error of reconstructions on a training set of (ground truth image, measurement) pairs. Training involves solving a challenging bilievel optimization problem; we derive an expression for the gradient of the training loss using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and provide an accompanying gradient descent algorithm to minimize it. Our experiments on a simple synthetic, denoising problem show that the proposed method can learn an operator that outperforms well-known regularizers (total variation, DCT-sparsity, and unsupervised dictionary learning) and collaborative filtering. While the approach we present is specific to denoising, we believe that it can be adapted to the whole class of inverse problems with linear measurement models, giving it applicability to a wide range of image reconstruction problems.

By removing stellar and telluric absorption and using a cross-correlation technique, we report tentative detection of neutral titanium with 4.4 sigma and a marginal signal of neutral iron with 2.8 sigma in the atmosphere. This is the first detection of neutral titanium in an exoplanetary atmosphere. In this temperature range, titanium tends to form titanium oxide (TiO). The fact that we did not detect any signal from TiO suggests that the C/O ratio in the atmosphere is higher than the solar value. The detection of metals in the atmosphere of hot Jupiters cooler than UHJs will be useful for understanding the atmospheric structure and formation history of hot Jupiters. ",astrophysics

"  It is shown that the dynamic differential scalar polarisability of the $S_{1/2}-D_{5/2}$ transition in $^{138}$Ba$^+$ can be determined to an inaccuracy below $0.5\%$ across a wide wavelength range ($\lambda>700\,\mathrm{nm}$). This can be achieved using measurements for which accurate determination of laser intensity is not required, and most of the required measurements are already in the literature. Measurement of a laser-induced ac-stark shift of the clock transition would then provide an \emph{in situ} measurement of the laser's intensity to the same $0.5\%$ level of inaccuracy, which is not easily achieved by other means.

"  The Be X-ray binary GRO J2058+42 recently went through a Type-II outburst during March-April 2019 lasting for about 50 days. This outburst was detected with the operating all sky X-ray monitors like the Fermi-GBM, Swift-BAT and MAXI-GSC. Two NuSTAR observations were also made, one during the rise and other during the decay of the outburst. It gave us the unique opportunity to analyze the broadband characteristics of the pulsar for the first time and accretion torque characteristics of the pulsar over a range of X-ray luminosity. The pulse profiles are strongly energy dependent, with at least four different pulse components at low energy (< 20 keV) which evolves to a single-peaked profile at high energy (> 30 keV). In each of the narrow energy bands, the pulse profiles are nearly identical in the two NuSTAR observations. The spectra from both the observations are fitted well to a power-law with a Fermi-Dirac type high energy cutoff. We ruled out presence of a cyclotron line in the pulse phase averaged X-ray spectrum in the NuSTAR band with an optical depth greater than 0.15. An iron emission line is detected in both the NuSTAR spectra with an equivalent width of about 125 eV. We looked at the dependence of the spin-up rate on the luminosity and estimated the magnetic field strength from that, which came out to be much higher compared to other known BeXRB pulsars.

"  In this thesis, we investigate all warped AdS$_4$ and AdS$_3$ backgrounds with the most general allowed fluxes that preserve more than 16 supersymmetries in 10- and 11-dimensional supergravities. Assuming either that the internal manifold is compact without boundary or that the isometry algebra of the background decomposes into that of AdS and that of the transverse space, we find that there are no AdS$_4$ backgrounds in IIB supergravity. Similarly, we find a unique such background with 24 supersymmetries in IIA supergravity, locally isometric to $AdS_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$. In 11-dimensional supergravity all more than half BPS AdS backgrounds are shown to be locally isometric to the maximally supersymmetric $AdS_4\times S^7$ solution. Furthermore, we prove a non-existence theorem for AdS$_3$ solutions preserving more than 16 supersymmetries.

"  During eruptive flares, vector magnetograms show increasing horizontal magnetic field and downward Lorentz force in the Sun's photosphere around the polarity-inversion line. Such behavior has often been associated with the implosion conjecture and interpreted as the result of either momentum conservation while the eruption moves upward, or of the contraction of flare loops. We characterize the physical origin of these observed behaviors by analyzing a generic 3D MHD simulation of an eruptive flare. Even though the simulation was undesigned to recover the magnetic field and Lorentz force properties, it is fully consistent with them, and it provides key additional informations to understand them. The area where the magnetic field increases gradually develops between current ribbons, which spread away from each other and are connected to the coronal region. This area is merely the footprint of the coronal post-flare loops, whose contraction increases their shear field component and the magnetic energy density in line with the ideal induction equation. For simulated data, we computed the Lorentz force density map by applying the method used in observations. We obtained increase of the downward component of the Lorentz force density around the PIL -consistent with observations. However, this significantly differs from the Lorentz force density maps obtained directly from the 3D magnetic field and current. These results altogether question previous interpretations based on the implosion conjecture and momentum conservation with the CME, and rather imply that the observed increases in photospheric horizontal magnetic fields result from the reconnection-driven contraction of sheared flare-loops.

  This is a review of old and new results and methods related to the Yau conjecture on the zero set of Laplace eigenfunctions.   The review accompanies two lectures given at the conference CDM 2018. We discuss the works of Donnelly and Fefferman including their solution of the conjecture in the case of real-analytic Riemannian manifolds.   The review exposes the new results for Yau's conjecture in the smooth setting. We try to avoid technical details and emphasize the main ideas of the proof of Nadirashvili's conjecture. We also discuss two-dimensional methods to study zero sets. ,mathematics
"  The prediction of electrical power in combined cycle power plants is a key challenge in the electrical power and energy systems field. This power output can vary depending on environmental variables, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. Thus, the business problem is how to predict the power output as a function of these environmental conditions in order to maximize the profit. The research community has solved this problem by applying machine learning techniques and has managed to reduce the computational and time costs in comparison with the traditional thermodynamical analysis. Until now, this challenge has been tackled from a batch learning perspective in which data is assumed to be at rest, and where models do not continuously integrate new information into already constructed models. We present an approach closer to the Big Data and Internet of Things paradigms in which data is arriving continuously and where models learn incrementally, achieving significant enhancements in terms of data processing (time, memory and computational costs), and obtaining competitive performances. This work compares and examines the hourly electrical power prediction of several streaming regressors, and discusses about the best technique in terms of time processing and performance to be applied on this streaming scenario.

"  We demonstrate several techniques to encourage practical uses of neural networks for fluid flow estimation. In the present paper, three perspectives which are remaining challenges for applications of machine learning to fluid dynamics are considered: 1. interpretability of machine-learned results, 2. bulking out of training data, and 3. generalizability of neural networks. For the interpretability, we first demonstrate two methods to observe the internal procedure of neural networks, i.e., visualization of hidden layers and application of gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), applied to canonical fluid flow estimation problems -- $(1)$ drag coefficient estimation of a cylinder wake and $(2)$ velocity estimation from particle images. It is exemplified that both approaches can successfully tell us evidences of the great capability of machine learning-based estimations. We then utilize some techniques to bulk out training data for super-resolution analysis and temporal prediction for cylinder wake and NOAA sea surface temperature data to demonstrate that sufficient training of neural networks with limited amount of training data can be achieved for fluid flow problems. The generalizability of machine learning model is also discussed by accounting for the perspectives of inter/extrapolation of training data, considering super-resolution of wakes behind two parallel cylinders. We find that various flow patterns generated by complex interaction between two cylinders can be reconstructed well, even for the test configurations regarding the distance factor. The present paper can be a significant step toward practical uses of neural networks for both laminar and turbulent flow problems. ",physics
"  In this article, we derive a general form of local volume-averaging theory and apply it to a model of zinc-air conversion batteries. Volume-averaging techniques are frequently used for the macroscopic description of micro-porous electrodes. We extend the existing method by including reactions between different phases and time-dependent volume fractions of the solid phases as these are continuously dissolved and reconstructed during operation of conversion batteries. We find that the constraint of incompressibility for multi-component fluids causes numerical instabilities in simulations of zinc-air battery cells. Therefore, we develop a stable sequential semi-implicit algorithm which converges against the fully implicit solution. Our method reduces the coupling of the variables by splitting the system of equations and introducing an additional iteration step. ",physics

"  The mechanical behavior of fractures in solids, such as rocks, has strong implications for reservoir engineering applications. Deformations, and the corresponding change in solid contact area and aperture field, impact rock fracture stiffness and permeability thus altering the reservoir properties significantly. Simulating contact between fractures is numerically difficult as the non-penetration constraints lead to a nonlinear problem and the surface meshes of the solid bodies on the opposing fracture sides may be non-matching. Furthermore, the challenging geometry of the arising constraints requires to solve the problem in several iterations, adjusting the constraints in each one. Here we present a novel discrete implementation of a dual mortar method and a non-smooth SQP solver, suitable for parallel computing, and apply it to a two body contact problem consisting of realistic rock fracture geometries from the Grimsel underground laboratory in Switzerland. The contributions of this article are: 1) a novel, parallel implementation of a dual mortar method and non-smooth SQP method, 2) realistic rock geometries with rough surfaces, and 3) numerical examples, which prove that the dual mortar method is capable of replicating the nonlinear closure behavior of fractures, observed in laboratory experiments.

"  We forecast constraints on the amplitude of matter clustering sigma_8(z) achievable with the combination of cluster weak lensing and number counts, in current and next-generation weak lensing surveys. We advocate an approach, analogous to galaxy-galaxy lensing, in which the observables in each redshift bin are the mean number counts and the mean weak lensing profile of clusters above a mass proxy threshold. The primary astrophysical nuisance parameter is the logarithmic scatter between the mass proxy and true mass near the threshold. For surveys similar to the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Roman Space Telescope High Latitude Survey (HLS), and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we forecast aggregate precision on sigma_8 of 0.26%, 0.24%, and 0.10%, respectively, if the mass-observable scatter has an external prior better than 0.01. These constraints would be degraded by about 20% for a 0.05 prior on scatter in the case of DES or HLS and for a 0.016 prior for LSST. A one-month observing program with Roman Space Telescope targeting approximately 2500 massive clusters could achieve a 0.5% constraint on sigma_8(z=0.7) on its own, or a ~0.33% constraint in combination with the HLS. Realizing the constraining power of clusters requires accurate knowledge of the mass-observable relation and stringent control of systematics. We provide analytic approximations to our numerical results that allow easy scaling to other survey assumptions or other methods of cluster mass estimation. ",astrophysics
"  Despite the great differences among cities, they face similar challenges regarding social inequality, politics and criminality. Urban art express these feelings from the citizen point-of-view. In particular, the drawing and painting of public surfaces may carry rich information about the time and region it was made. Existing studies have explored the spatial distribution of graffiti, but most of them considered graffiti as a whole, with no separation among the types. Also, the analyses rarely take into account the city topology. In this work, we propose to categorize the graffiti into three types: simple scribbles, complex scribbles, canvases. We analyze the spatial distribution and identify the spatial bias of each type. To further analyze the spatial distribution of the types, we apply concepts from complex networks. First, regions (communities) defined by the connectivity profiles of the city network are obtained and the prevalence of each type of graffiti over these regions are analyzed. Next, a measure based on the dynamics of the network (accessibility) is calculated and compared to the distribution of the graffiti types. A case study is performed in the analysis of three different categories of graffiti in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results showed that the categories present characteristic spatial distributions. The ratio of each type per community of the network, though, does not pose significant deviations. Finally, a small positive correlation was observed between the locations of each graffiti type and the accessibility. ",physics
"  Human brain activity generates scalp potentials (electroencephalography EEG), intracranial potentials (iEEG), and external magnetic fields (magnetoencephalography MEG), all capable of being recorded, often simultaneously, for use in research and clinical applications. The so-called forward problem is the modeling of these fields at their sensors for a given putative neural source configuration. While early generations modeled the head as a simple set of isotropic spheres, today s ubiquitous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data allows detailed descriptions of head compartments with assigned isotropic and anisotropic conductivities. In this paper, we present a complete pipeline, integrated into the Brainstorm software, that allows users to generate an individual and accurate head model from the MRI and then calculate the electromagnetic forward solution using the finite element method (FEM). The head model generation is performed by the integration of the latest tools for MRI segmentation and FEM mesh generation. The final head model is divided into five main compartments: white matter, grey matter, CSF, skull, and scalp. For the isotropic compartments, widely-used default conductivity values are assigned. For the brain tissues, we use the process of the effective medium approach (EMA) to estimate anisotropic conductivity tensors from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data. The FEM electromagnetic calculations are performed by the DUNEuro library, integrated into Brainstorm and accessible with a user-friendly graphical interface. This integrated pipeline, with full tutorials and example data sets freely available on the Brainstorm website, gives the neuroscience community easy access to advanced tools for electromagnetic modeling using FEM.

"  Existence of a spectral singularity (SS) in the spectrum of {a Schr\""{o}dinger operator with} a non-Hermitian potential requires exact matching of parameters of the potential. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a potential to have a SS at a given wavelength. It is shown that potentials with SSs at prescribed wavelengths can be obtained by a simple and effective procedure. In particular, the developed approach allows one to obtain potentials with several SSs and with SSs of the second order, as well as potentials obeying a given symmetry, say, $\PT-$symmetric potentials. Also, the problem can be solved when it is required to obtain a potential obeying a given symmetry, say, $\PT-$symmetric potential. We illustrate all these opportunities with examples. We also describe splitting of a second-order SSs under change of the potential parameters, and discuss possibilities of experimental observation of SSs of different orders. ",physics
"  We present experimental data providing evidence for the formation of transient ($\sim 20~\mu$s) plasmas that are simultaneously weakly magnetized (i.e., Hall magnetization parameter $\omega \tau > 1$) and dominated by thermal pressure (i.e., ratio of thermal-to-magnetic pressure $\beta > 1$). Particle collisional mean free paths are an appreciable fraction of the overall system size. These plasmas are formed via the head-on merging of two plasmas launched by magnetized coaxial guns. The ratio $\lambda_{gun}=\mu_0 I_{gun}/\psi_{gun}$ of gun current $I_{gun}$ to applied magnetic flux $\psi_{gun}$ is an experimental knob for exploring the parameter space of $\beta$ and $\omega \tau$. These experiments were conducted on the Big Red Ball at the Wisconsin Plasma Physics Laboratory. The transient formation of such plasmas can potentially open up new regimes for the laboratory study of weakly collisional, magnetized, high-$\beta$ plasma physics; processes relevant to astrophysical objects and phenomena; and novel magnetized plasma targets for magneto-inertial fusion.

"  A radar and communication integration (RCI) system has great flexibility in allocating antenna resources to guarantee both radar and communication performance. This paper considers the array allocation problems for multiple target localization and multiple platforms communication in an RCI network. The objective of array allocation is to maximize the communication capacity for each channel and to minimize the localization error for each target. In this paper, we firstly build a localization and communication model for array allocation in an RCI network. Minorization maximization (MM) is then applied to create surrogate functions for multiple objective optimization problems. The projected gradient descent (PGD) method is further employed to solve two array allocation problems with and without a certain communication capacity constraint. Computer simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithms have improved localization and communication performance after efficiently allocating the array resource in the RCI network.

"  Dark matter-baryon scaling relations in galaxies are important in order to constrain galaxy formation models. Here, we provide a modern quantitative assessment of those relations, by modelling the rotation curves of galaxies from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves (SPARC) database with the Einasto dark halo model. We focus in particular on the comparison between the original SPARC parameters, with constant mass-to-light ratios for bulges and disks, and the parameters for which galaxies follow the tightest radial acceleration relation. We show that fits are improved in the second case, and that the pure halo scaling relations also become tighter. We report that the density at the radius where the slope is -2 is strongly anticorrelated to this radius, and to the Einasto index. The latter is close to unity for a large number of galaxies, indicative of large cores. In terms of dark matter-baryon scalings, we focus on relations between the core properties and the extent of the baryonic component, which are relevant to the cusp-core transformation process. We report a positive correlation between the core size of halos with small Einasto index and the stellar disk scale-length, as well as between the averaged dark matter density within 2 kpc and the baryon-induced rotational velocity at that radius. This finding is related to the consequence of the radial acceleration relation on the diversity of rotation curve shapes, quantified by the rotational velocity at 2 kpc. While a tight radial acceleration relation slightly decreases the observed diversity compared to the original SPARC parameters, the diversity of baryon-induced accelerations at 2 kpc is sufficient to induce a large diversity, incompatible with current hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, while maintaining a tight radial acceleration relation.

"  In the 1970s, Fathi, having proven that the group of compactly supported volume-preserving homeomorphisms of the $n$-ball is simple for $n \ge 3$, asked if the same statement holds in dimension $2$. We show that the group of compactly supported area-preserving homeomorphisms of the two-disc is not simple. This settles what is known as the ""simplicity conjecture"" in the affirmative. In fact, we prove the a priori stronger statement that this group is not perfect.   An important step in our proof involves verifying for certain smooth twist maps a conjecture of Hutchings concerning recovering the Calabi invariant from the asymptotics of spectral invariants defined using periodic Floer homology. Another key step, which builds on recent advances in continuous symplectic topology, involves proving that these spectral invariants extend continuously to area-preserving homeomorphisms of the disc. These two properties of PFH spectral invariants are potentially of independent interest.   Our general strategy is partially inspired by suggestions of Fathi and the approach of Oh towards the simplicity question. In particular, we show that infinite twist maps, studied by Oh, are not finite energy homeomorphisms, which resolves the ""infinite twist conjecture"" in the affirmative; these twist maps are now the first examples of Hamiltonian homeomorphisms which can be said to have infinite energy. Another consequence of our work is that various forms of fragmentation for volume preserving homeomorphisms which hold for higher dimensional balls fail in dimension two. ",mathematics
"  A general attenuator $\Phi_{\lambda, \sigma}$ is a bosonic quantum channel that acts by combining the input with a fixed environment state $\sigma$ in a beam splitter of transmissivity $\lambda$. If $\sigma$ is a thermal state the resulting channel is a thermal attenuator, whose quantum capacity vanishes for $\lambda\leq 1/2$. We study the quantum capacity of these objects for generic $\sigma$, proving a number of unexpected results. Most notably, we show that for any arbitrary value of $\lambda>0$ there exists a suitable single-mode state $\sigma(\lambda)$ such that the quantum capacity of $\Phi_{\lambda,\sigma(\lambda)}$ is larger than a universal constant $c>0$. Our result holds even when we fix an energy constraint at the input of the channel, and implies that quantum communication at a constant rate is possible even in the limit of arbitrarily low transmissivity, provided that the environment state is appropriately controlled. We also find examples of states $\sigma$ such that the quantum capacity of $\Phi_{\lambda,\sigma}$ is not monotonic in $\lambda$. These findings may have implications for the study of communication lines running across integrated optical circuits, of which general attenuators provide natural models. ",quantum physics

"  Physical systems may couple to other systems through variables that are not gauge invariant. When we split a gauge system into two subsystems, the gauge-invariant variables of the two subsystems have less information than the gauge invariant variables of the original system; the missing information regards degrees of freedom that express relations between the subsystems. All this shows that gauge invariance is a formalization of the relational nature of physical degrees of freedom.

"  Entropy and energy are found to be closely tied on our quest for quantum gravity. We point out an interesting connection between the recently proposed outer entropy, a coarse-grained entropy defined for a compact spacetime domain motivated by the holographic duality, and the Bartnik-Bray quasilocal mass long known in the mathematics community. In both scenarios, one seeks an optimal spacetime fill-in of a given closed, connected, spacelike, codimension-two boundary. We show that for an outer-minimizing mean-convex surface, the Bartnik-Bray inner mass matches exactly with the irreducible mass corresponding to the outer entropy. The equivalence implies that the area laws derived from the outer entropy are mathematically equivalent as the monotonicity property of the quasilocal mass. It also gives rise to new bounds between entropy and the gravitational energy, which naturally gives the gravitational counterpart to Wall's ant conjecture. We also observe that the equality can be achieved in a conformal flow of metrics, which is structurally similar to the Ceyhan-Faulkner proof of the ant conjecture. We compute the small sphere limit of the outer entropy and it is proportional to the bulk stress tensor as one would expect for a quasilocal mass. Lastly, we discuss some implications of taking quantum matter into consideration in the semiclassical setting. ",high energy physics theory

"  Chemical abundances in the Leo ring, the largest HI cloud in the local Universe, have recently been determined to be close or above solar, incompatible with a previously claimed primordial origin of the ring. The gas, pre-enriched in a galactic disk and tidally stripped, did not manage to form stars very efficiently in intergalactic space. We map nebular lines in 3 dense HI clumps of the Leo ring and complement these data with archival stellar continuum observations to investigate the slow building up of a sparse population of stars in localized areas of the ring. Individual young stars as massive as O7-types are powering some HII regions. The average star formation rate density is of order of 10^{-5} Msun/yr/kpc^2 and proceeds with local bursts a few hundred parsecs in size, where loose stellar associations of 500-1000 Msun occasionally host massive outliers. The far ultraviolet-to-Halpha emission ratio in nebular regions implies recent stellar bursts, from 2 to 7 Myr ago. The relation between the local HI gas density and the star formation rate in the ring is similar to what is found in dwarfs and outer disks with gas depletion times as long as 100~Gyrs. We find a candidate planetary nebula in a compact and faint Halpha region with [OIII]/Halpha line enhancement, consistent with the estimated mean stellar surface brightness of the ring. The presence of 1 kpc partial ring emitting weak Halpha lines around the brightest and youngest HII region suggests that local shocks might be the triggers of new star forming events. ",astrophysics

"  A constrained BRST-BV Lagrangian formulation for totally symmetric massless HS fields in a $d$-dimensional Minkowski space is extended to a non-minimal constrained BRST-BV Lagrangian formulation by using a non-minimal BRST operator $Q_{c|\mathrm{tot}}$ with non-minimal Hamiltonian BFV oscillators $\overline{C}, \overline{\mathcal{P}}, \lambda, \pi$, as well as antighost and Nakanishi-Lautrup tensor fields, in order to introduce an admissible self-consistent gauge condition.

"  Electromyogram (EMG) classification is a key technique in EMG-based control systems. The existing EMG classification methods do not consider the characteristics of EMG features that the distribution has skewness and kurtosis, causing drawbacks such as the requirement of hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a neural network based on the Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$ translation system that is capable of representing distributions with skewness and kurtosis. The Johnson system is a normalizing translation that transforms non-normal data to a normal distribution, thereby enabling the representation of a wide range of distributions. In this study, a discriminative model based on the multivariate Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$ translation system is transformed into a linear combination of coefficients and input vectors using log-linearization. This is then incorporated into a neural network structure, thereby allowing the calculation of the posterior probability of the input vectors for each class and the determination of model parameters as weight coefficients of the network. The uniqueness of convergence of the network learning is theoretically guaranteed. In the experiments, the suitability of the proposed network for distributions including skewness and kurtosis is evaluated using artificially generated data. Its applicability for real biological data is also evaluated via an EMG classification experiment. The results show that the proposed network achieves high classification performance without the need for hyperparameter optimization. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  This paper proposes a line integral Lyapunov function approach to stability analysis and stabilization for It\^o stochastic T-S models. Unlike the deterministic case, stability analysis of this model needs the information of Hessian matrix of the line integral Lyapunov function which is related to partial derivatives of the basis functions. By introducing a new method to handle these partial derivatives and using the property of state-dependent matrix with rank one, the stability conditions of the underlying system can be established via a line integral Lyapunov function. These conditions obtained are more general than the ones which are based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. Based on the stability conditions, a controller is developed by cone complementarity linerization algorithm. A non-quadratic Lyapunov function approach is thus proposed for the stabilization problem of the It\^o stochastic T-S models. It has been shown that the problem can be solved by optimizing sum of traces for a group of products of matrix variables with linear constraints. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Affine registration of one or several brain image(s) onto a common reference space is a necessary prerequisite for many image processing tasks, such as brain segmentation or functional analysis. Manual assessment of registration quality is a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in studies comprising a large amount of data. An automated and reliable quality control (QC) becomes mandatory. Moreover, the computation time of the QC must be also compatible with the processing of massive datasets. Therefore, an automated deep neural network approaches appear as a method of choice to automatically assess registration quality.   In the current study, a compact 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), referred to as RegQCNET, is introduced to quantitatively predict the amplitude of an affine registration mismatch between a registered image and a reference template. This quantitative estimation of registration error is expressed using metric unit system. Therefore, a meaningful task-specific threshold can be manually or automatically defined in order to distinguish usable and non-usable images.   The robustness of the proposed RegQCNET is first analyzed on lifespan brain images undergoing various simulated spatial transformations and intensity variations between training and testing. Secondly, the potential of RegQCNET to classify images as usable or non-usable is evaluated using both manual and automatic thresholds. During our experiments, automatic thresholds are estimated using several computer-assisted classification models through cross-validation. To this end we used expert's visual quality control estimated on a lifespan cohort of 3953 brains. Finally, the RegQCNET accuracy is compared to usual image features.   Results show that the proposed deep learning QC is robust, fast and accurate to estimate affine registration error in processing pipeline. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  In this work we show the existence of asymptotically AdS wormhole geometries where the scalar probe has an equispaced, fully resonant spectrum, as that of a scalar on AdS spacetime, and explore its dynamics when non-linearities are included. The spacetime is a solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with a single maximally symmetric vacuum. Introducing a non-minimal coupling between the scalar probe and the Ricci scalar remarkably leads to a fully resonant spectrum for a scalar field fulfilling reflective boundary conditions at both infinities. Applying perturbative methods, which are particularly useful for unveiling the dynamics at time scales of order $\varepsilon^{-2}$ (where $\varepsilon$ characterizes the amplitude of the initial perturbation), we observe both direct and inverse energy cascades between modes. This motivates us to explore the energy returns in the case in which the dynamics is dominated by a single mode. We find numerical and perturbative evidence that near exact returns do exist in this regime. We also provide some comments on the fully backreracting case and provide a proof of the universality of the weakly non-linear dynamics around AdS, in the context of Lovelock theories with generic couplings, up to times of order $\varepsilon^{-2}$.

"  Tree-level Feynman diagrams in a cubic scalar theory can be given a metric such that each edge has a length. The space of metric trees is made out of orthants joined where a tree degenerates. Here we restrict to planar trees since each degeneration of a tree leads to a single planar neighbor. Amplitudes are computed as an integral over the space of metrics where edge lengths are Schwinger parameters. In this work we propose that a natural generalization of Feynman diagrams is provided by what are known as metric tree arrangements. These are collections of metric trees subject to a compatibility condition on the metrics. We introduce the notion of planar collections of Feynman diagrams and argue that using planarity one can generate all planar collections starting from any one.

"  We employ the curvature expansion of the quantum effective action for gravity-matter systems to construct graviton-mediated scattering amplitudes for non-minimally coupled scalar fields in a Minkowski background. By design, the formalism parameterises all quantum corrections to these processes and is manifestly gauge-invariant. The conditions resulting from UV-finiteness, unitarity, and causality are analysed in detail and it is shown by explicit construction that the quantum effective action provides sufficient room to meet these structural requirements without introducing non-localities or higher-spin degrees of freedom. Our framework provides a bottom-up approach to all quantum gravity programs seeking for the quantisation of gravity within the framework of quantum field theory. Its scope is illustrated by specific examples, including effective field theory, Stelle gravity, infinite derivative gravity, and Asymptotic Safety. ",high energy physics theory
"  We prove a nonlinear variant of the general Brascamp-Lieb inequality. Instances of this inequality are quite prevalent in analysis, and we illustrate this with substantial applications in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations. Our proof consists of running an efficient, or ""tight"", induction on scales argument, which uses the existence of gaussian near-extremisers to the underlying linear Brascamp-Lieb inequality (Lieb's theorem) in a fundamental way. A key ingredient is an effective version of Lieb's theorem, which we establish via a careful analysis of near-minimisers of weighted sums of exponential functions. ",mathematics
"  It is challenging to visually detect heart disease from the electrocardiographic (ECG) signals. Implementing an automated ECG signal detection system can help diagnosis arrhythmia in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. In this paper, we proposed, implemented, and compared an automated system using two different frameworks of the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM) for classifying normal sinus signals, atrial fibrillation, and other noisy signals. The dataset we used is from the MIT-BIT Arrhythmia Physionet. Our approach demonstrated that the cascade of two deep learning network has higher performance than the concatenation of them, achieving a weighted f1 score of 0.82. The experimental results have successfully validated that the cascade of CNN and LSTM can achieve satisfactory performance on discriminating ECG signals. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Here, we propose a topological bandgap fibre whose bandgaps along in-plane directions are opened by generalized Kekul\'e modulation of a Dirac lattice with a vortex phase. Then, the existence of mid-gap defect modes is guaranteed to guide light at the core of this Dirac-vortex fibre, where the number of guiding modes equals the winding number of the spatial vortex. The single-vortex design provides a single-polarization single mode for a bandwidth as large as one octave. ",physics
"  In this work, we propose a unified spatio-temporal model to study the temporal dynamics in continuously pumped ytterbium-doped fiber lasers (YDFLs). Different from previously reported theories, this model is capable of obtaining the temporal evolution of an YDFL from relaxation oscillation region to relative stable region in different time scales ranging from sub-nanosecond to millisecond. It reveals that there exists dual time scale characteristics in the temporal evolution of a multi-longitudinal mode YDFL. Specifically, the temporal evolution would experience sharp change during one cavity round-trip while keep relatively stable between adjacent cavity round-trips. Representative cases are simulated to study the influences of structure parameters on the temporal dynamics and the longitudinal mode characteristics in YDFLs. Three types of temporal instabilities, i.e. sustained self-pulsing, self-mode locking, and turbulence-like pulsing, coexist in a multi-longitudinal mode YDFL. The simulation results clarify that the three temporal instabilities are all the reflectors of intrinsic characteristics of longitudinal modes superposition in multi-longitudinal mode YDFLs. In addition, the strength of the irregular sustained self-pulsing is the major issue which impacts the macroscopic temporal fluctuations in YDFLs. ",physics
"  Resilience curves track the accumulation and restoration of outages during an event on an electric distribution grid. We show that a resilience curve generated from utility data can always be decomposed into an outage process and a restore process and that these processes generally overlap in time. We use many events in real utility data to characterize the statistics of these processes, and derive formulas based on these statistics for resilience metrics such as restore duration, customer hours not served, and outage and restore rates. The formulas express the mean value of these metrics as a function of the number of outages in the event. We also give a formula for the variability of restore duration, which allows us to predict a maximum restore duration with 95% confidence. Overall, we give a simple and general way to decompose resilience curves into outage and restore processes and then show how to use these processes to extract resilience metrics from standard distribution system data.

"  Cryo-electron microscopy is a revolutionary technique that can provide 3D density maps at near-atomic resolution. However, map validation is still an open issue in the field. Despite several efforts from the community, it is possible to overfit the reconstructions to noisy data. Here, inspired by modern statistics, we develop a novel methodology that uses a small independent particle set to validate the 3D maps. The main idea is to monitor how the map probability evolves over the control set during the refinement. The method is complementary to the gold-standard procedure, which generates two reconstructions at each iteration. We low-pass filter the two reconstructions for different frequency cutoffs, and we calculate the probability of each filtered map given the control set. For high-quality maps, the probability should increase as a function of the frequency cutoff and of the refinement iteration. We also compute the similarity between the probability distributions of the two reconstructions. As higher frequencies are added to the maps, more dissimilar are the distributions. We optimized the BioEM software package to perform these calculations, and tested the method on several systems, some which were overfitted. Our results show that our method is able to discriminate the overfitted sets from the non-overfitted ones. We conclude that having a control particle set, not used for the refinement, is essential for cross-validating cryo-EM maps. ",physics
"  Misalignment angle will result in a considerable error for the integration of Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and of Strapdown Inertial Navigation System (SINS). In this paper, a robust initial alignment method for SINS/DVL is proposed to solve a practical applicable issue, which is that the outputs of DVL are often corrupted by the outliers. Firstly, the alignment principle for SINS/DVL is summarized. Secondly, based on the principle of this alignment method, the apparent velocity model is investigated, and the parameters expression of the apparent velocity model are derived detailed. Using the apparent velocity model, the unknown parameters of the apparent velocity model are estimated by the developed Robust Kalman Filter (RKF), then the reconstructed observation vector, where the outliers are detected and isolated, is reconstructed by the estimated parameters. Based on the reconstructed observation vectors, the initial attitude is determined. Finally, the simulation and field tests are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. The test results are shown that the proposed method can detect and isolate the outliers effectively and get better performance than the previous work. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We study holographic entanglement entropy in four-dimensional quantum gravity with negative cosmological constant. By using the replica trick and evaluating path integrals in the minisuperspace approximation, in conjunction with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, we compute quantum corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy for a circular entangling surface on the boundary three sphere. Similarly to our previous work on the sphere partition function, the path integrals are dominated by a replica version of asymptotically AdS conic geometries at saddle points. As expected from a general CFT argument, the final result is minus the free energy on the three sphere which agrees with the logarithm of the Airy partition function for the ABJM theory that sums up all perturbative $1/N$ corrections despite the absence of supersymmetries. The all-order holographic entanglement entropy cleanly splits into two parts, (1) the $1/N$-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi minimal surface area and (2) the bulk entanglement entropy across the minimal surface, as suggested in the earlier literature. It is explicitly shown that the former comes from the localized conical singularity of the replica geometries and the latter from the replication of the bulk volume. ",high energy physics theory
"  We investigate feasible holography with the Kitaev model using dilatonic gravity in AdS$_2$. We propose a generic dual theory of gravity in the AdS$_2$ and suggest that this bulk action is a suitable toy model in studying quantum mechanics in the Kitaev model using gauge/gravity duality. This gives a possible equivalent description for the Kitaev model in the dual gravity bulk. Scalar and tensor perturbations are investigated in detail. In the case of near AdS perturbation, we show that the geometry still ""freezes"" as is AdS, while the dilation perturbation decays at the AdS boundary safely. The time-dependent part of the perturbation is an oscillatory model. We discover that the dual gravity induces an effective and renormalizable quantum action. The entanglement entropy for bulk theory is computed using extremal surfaces. We prove that these surfaces have a fold bifurcation regime of criticality. Our approach shows directly that chaos in AdS$_2$ can be understood via fold bifurcation minimal surfaces. ",high energy physics theory

We compute the correlation function of four electromagnetic currents and explain in detail the steps needed to extract the event shape from it. The result is compared to the standard amplitude calculation. The explicit four-point correlation function may also be of interest for the CFT community. ",high energy physics theory
"  One of the main challenges in building a quantum processor is to characterize the environmental noise. Noise characterization can be achieved by exploiting different techniques, such as randomization where several sequences of random quantum gates are applied to the qubit under test to derive statistical characteristics about the affecting noises. A scalable and robust algorithm able to benchmark the full set of Clifford gates using randomization techniques is called randomized benchmarking. In this study, we simulated randomized benchmarking protocols in a semiconducting all-electrical three-electron double-quantum dot qubit, i.e. hybrid qubit, under different error models, that include quasi-static Gaussian and the more realistic 1/f noise model, for the input controls. The average error of specific quantum computational gates is extracted through interleaved randomized benchmarking obtained including Clifford gates between the gate of interest. It provides an estimate of the fidelity as well as theoretical bounds for the average error of the gate under test. ",quantum physics
"  The extended state observer (ESO) plays an important role in the design of feedback control for nonlinear systems. However, its high-gain nature creates a challenge in engineering practice in cases where the output measurement is corrupted by non-negligible, high-frequency noise. The presence of such noise puts a constraint on how high the observer gains can be, which forces a trade-off between fast convergence of state estimates and quality of control task realization. In this work, a new observer design is proposed to improve the estimation performance in the presence of noise. In particular, a unique cascade combination of ESOs is developed, which is capable of fast and accurate signals reconstruction, while avoiding over-amplification of the measurement noise. The effectiveness of the introduced observer structure is verified here while working as a part of an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme. The conducted numerical validation and theoretical analysis of the new observer structure show improvement over standard solution in terms of noise attenuation.

"  An extensive spectroscopic study on \xi Boo A (chromospherically active solar-type star) was conducted based on the spectra obtained in 2008 December though 2010 May, with an aim to detect any spectrum variability and to understand its physical origin. For each spectrum, the atmospheric parameters were spectroscopically determined based on Fe lines, and the equivalent widths (along with the line-broadening parameters) of selected 99 lines were measured. We could detect meaningful small fluctuations in the equivalent widths of medium-strength lines. This variation was found to correlate with the effective temperature (T_eff) consistently with the T-sensitivity of each line, which indicates that the difference in the mean temperature averaged over the disk of inhomogeneous condition is mainly responsible for this variability. It was also found that the macrobroadening widths of medium-strength lines and the equivalent widths dispersion of saturated lines tend to increase with the effective Lande factor, suggesting an influence of magnetic field. Our power spectrum analysis applied to the time-sequence data of V I/Fe II line-strength ratio and T_eff could not confirm the 6.4 d period reported by previous studies. We suspect that surface inhomogeneities of \xi Boo A at the time of our observations were not so much simple (such as single star patch) as rather complex (e.g., intricate aggregate of spots and faculae).

"  We present a novel framework for simulating matrix models on a quantum computer.

Regularization is performed for the BMN matrix model with the introduction of energy cut-off via the truncation in the Fock space.

  Two-qubit gates in trapped ion quantum computers are generated by applying spin-dependent forces that temporarily entangle the internal state of the ion with its motion. Laser pulses are carefully designed to generate a maximally entangling gate between the ions while minimizing any residual entanglement between the motion and the ion. The quality of the gates suffers when actual experimental parameters differ from the ideal case. Here we improve the robustness of frequency-modulated M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates to motional mode frequency offsets by optimizing average performance over a range of systematic errors using batch optimization. We then compare this method to frequency modulated gates optimized for ideal parameters that include an analytic robustness condition. Numerical simulations show good performance up to 12 ions and the method is experimentally demonstrated on a two-ion chain. ,quantum physics

"  Improvements in atom-light coherence are foundational to progress in quantum information science, quantum optics, and precision metrology. Optical atomic clocks require local oscillators with exceptional optical coherence due to the challenge of performing spectroscopy on their ultra-narrow linewidth clock transitions. Advances in laser stabilization have thus enabled rapid progress in clock precision. A new class of ultrastable lasers based on cryogenic silicon reference cavities has recently demonstrated the longest optical coherence times to date. In this work we utilize such a local oscillator, along with a state-of-the-art frequency comb for coherence transfer, with two Sr optical lattice clocks to achieve an unprecedented level of clock stability. Through an anti-synchronous comparison, the fractional instability of both clocks is assessed to be $4.8\times 10^{-17}/\sqrt{\tau}$ for an averaging time $\tau$ in seconds. Synchronous interrogation reveals a quantum projection noise dominated instability of $3.5(2)\times10^{-17}/\sqrt{\tau}$, resulting in a precision of $5.8(3)\times 10^{-19}$ after a single hour of averaging. The ability to measure sub-$10^{-18}$ level frequency shifts in such short timescales will impact a wide range of applications for clocks in quantum sensing and fundamental physics. For example, this precision allows one to resolve the gravitational red shift from a 1 cm elevation change in only 20 minutes. ",physics
"  We investigate the following version of the well-known R\'enyi-Ulam game. Two players - the Questioner and the Responder - play against each other. The Responder thinks of a number from the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ and the Questioner has to find this number. To do this, he can ask if the sought number is an element of a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with at most $k$ elements. The Responder answers with YES or NO immediately, but during the game he may lie at most $\ell$ times. The minimal number of queries needed for the Questioner to find the unknown element in the worst case is denoted by $RU_\ell^k(n)$. First, we develop a highly effective tool, which we call Convexity Lemma. Using this, we give a general lower bound of $RU_\ell^k(n)$ with an error at most $2\ell+1$, and we also give its exact value when $n$ is sufficiently large with respect to $k$.

"  Wave shape (e.g. wave skewness and asymmetry) impacts sediment transport, remote sensing and ship safety. Previous work showed that wind affects wave shape in intermediate and deep water. Here, we investigate the effect of wind on wave shape in shallow water through a wind-induced surface pressure for different wind speeds and directions to provide the first theoretical description of wind-induced shape changes. A multiple-scale analysis of long waves propagating over a shallow, flat bottom and forced by a Jeffreys-type surface pressure yields a forward or backward Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers equation for the wave profile, depending on the wind direction. The evolution of a symmetric, solitary-wave initial condition is calculated numerically. The resulting wave grows (decays) for onshore (offshore) wind and becomes asymmetric, with the rear face showing the largest shape changes. The wave profile's deviation from a reference solitary wave is primarily a bound wave and trailing, dispersive, decaying tail. The onshore wind increases the wave's energy and skewness with time while decreasing the wave's asymmetry, with the opposite holding for offshore wind. The corresponding wind speeds are shown to be physically realistic, and the shape changes are explained as slow growth followed by rapid evolution according to the unforced KdV equation. ",physics

Here, $\textbf{r}$ is a separation vector. The viscous, forcing, anisotropy and nonstationary terms in the generalized equation are quantified. It is found that the influence of the anisotropic terms on the four-fifths law is negligible at small scales, compared to that of the viscous term. However, the influence of the directional anisotropy, which is measured by the departure of the third-order moments in a particular direction of $\textbf{r}$ from the spherically averaged ones, on the four-fifths law is suggested to be substantial, at least in the case studied here.

"  Hybrid analog-digital precoding significantly reduces the hardware costs in massive MIMO transceivers when compared to fully-digital precoding at the expense of increased transmit power. In order to mitigate the above shortfall, we use the concept of constructive interference-based precoding, which has been shown to offer significant transmit power savings when compared with the conventional interference suppression-based precoding in fully-digital multiuser MIMO systems. Moreover, in order to circumvent the potential quality-of-service degradation at the users due to the hardware impairments in the transmitters, we judiciously incorporate robustness against such vulnerabilities in the precoder design. Since the undertaken constructive interference-based robust hybrid precoding problem is nonconvex with infinite constraints and thus difficult to solve optimally, we decompose the problem into two subtasks, namely, analog precoding and digital precoding. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to compute the optimal constructive interference-based robust digital precoders. Furthermore, we devise a scheme to facilitate the implementation of the proposed algorithm in a low-complexity and distributed manner. We also discuss block-level analog precoding techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm and its implementation scheme over the state-of-the-art methods. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  We extend the cosmological bootstrap to correlators involving massless particles with spin. In de Sitter space, these correlators are constrained both by symmetries and by locality. In particular, the de Sitter isometries become conformal symmetries on the future boundary of the spacetime, which are reflected in a set of Ward identities that the boundary correlators must satisfy. We solve these Ward identities by acting with weight-shifting operators on scalar seed solutions. Using this weight-shifting approach, we derive three- and four-point correlators of massless spin-1 and spin-2 fields with conformally coupled scalars. Four-point functions arising from tree-level exchange are singular in particular kinematic configurations, and the coefficients of these singularities satisfy certain factorization properties. We show that in many cases these factorization limits fix the structure of the correlators uniquely, without having to solve the conformal Ward identities. The additional constraint of locality for massless spinning particles manifests itself as current conservation on the boundary. We find that the four-point functions only satisfy current conservation if the s, t, and u-channels are related to each other, leading to nontrivial constraints on the couplings between the conserved currents and other operators in the theory. For spin-1 currents this implies charge conservation, while for spin-2 currents we recover the equivalence principle from a purely boundary perspective. For multiple spin-1 fields, we recover the structure of Yang-Mills theory. Finally, we apply our methods to slow-roll inflation and derive a few phenomenologically relevant scalar-tensor three-point functions. ",high energy physics theory

"  The work derives the quantum evolution in a fluctuating vacuum by introducing the related (dark) mass density noise into the Madelung quantum hydrodynamic model. The paper shows that the classical dynamics can spontaneously emerge on the cosmological scale allowing the realization of the classical system-environment super system. The work shows that the dark matter-induced noise is not spatially white and owns a well defined correlation function with the intrinsic vacuum physical length given by the De Broglie one. The resulting model, in the case of microscopic systems, whose dimension is much smaller than the De Broglie length, leads to the Langevin-Schrodinger equation whose friction coefficient is not constant. The derivation puts in evidence the range of application of the Langevin-Schrodinger equation and the approximations inherent to its foundation. The work shows that the classical physics can be achieved in a description whose length scale is much bigger both than the De Broglie length and the quantum potential range of interaction. The model shows that the quantum-to-classical transition is not possible in linear systems, and defines the long-distance characteristics as well as the range of interaction of the non-local quantum potential in order to have a coarse-grained large-scale classical phase. The theory also shows that the process of measurement (by a large-scale classical observer) satisfies the minimum uncertainty conditions if interactions and information do not travel faster than the light speed, reconciling the quantum entanglement with the relativistic macroscopic locality.

"  The galaxy bispectrum contains a wealth of information about the early universe, gravity, as well as astrophysics such as galaxy bias. In this paper, we study the parity-odd part of the galaxy bispectrum which is hitherto unexplored. In the standard cosmological model, the odd-parity bispectrum is generated by galaxy velocities through redshift-space distortions. While small in the case of General Relativity coupled with smooth dark energy, the signal could be larger in modified gravity scenarios. Thus, apart from being a very useful consistency test of measurements of galaxy clustering, the odd bispectrum offers a novel avenue for searching for new physics. ",astrophysics

"  We study certain topological problems that are inspired by applications to autonomous robot manipulation. Consider a continuous map $f\colon X\to Y$, where $f$ can be a kinematic map from the configuration space $X$ to the working space $Y$ of a robot arm or a similar mechanism. Then one can associate to $f$ a number $\mathrm{TC}(f)$, which is, roughly speaking, the minimal number of continuous rules that are necessary to construct a complete manipulation algorithm for the device. Examples show that $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ is very sensitive to small perturbations of $f$ and that its value depends heavily on the singularities of $f$. This fact considerably complicates the computations, so we focus here on estimates of $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ that can be expressed in terms of homotopy invariants of spaces $X$ and $Y$, or that are valid if $f$ satisfy some additional assumptions like, for example, being a fibration.   Some of the main results are the derivation of a general upper bound for $\mathrm{TC}(f)$, invariance of $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ with respect to deformations of the domain and codomain, proof that $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ is a FHE-invariant, and the description of a cohomological lower bound for $\mathrm{TC}(f)$. Furthermore, if $f$ is a fibration we derive more precise estimates for $\mathrm{TC}(f)$ in terms of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and the topological complexity of $X$ and $Y$. We also obtain some results for the important special case of covering projections. ",mathematics
"  We study a charged scalar field in a bulk 3+1 dimensional anti-deSitter spacetime with a planar black hole background metric. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence this is equivalent to a strongly coupled field theory in 2+1 dimensions describing a superconductor. We use the gradient flow method and solve the flow equations numerically between two fixed points: a vacuum solution and a hairy black hole solution. We study the corresponding flow on the boundary between a normal metal phase and a superconducting phase. We show how the gradient flow moves fields between two fixed points in a way that minimizes the free energy of the system. At the fixed points of the flow the AdS/CFT correspondence provides an equivalence between the Euclidean on-shell action in the bulk and the free energy of the boundary, but it does not tell us about fields away from equilibrium. However, we can formally link static off-shell configurations in the bulk and in the boundary at the same point along the flow. For quasi-static evolution at least, it may be reasonable to think of this link as an extension of the AdS/CFT correspondance. ",high energy physics theory

The required enhancement of primordial fluctuations compared to their value at CMB scales naturally occurs when the inflationary trajectory in the landscape exhibits a limited period of strongly non-geodesic motion. Such trajectories with multiple dynamical fields are motivated by the search for ultraviolet completions of inflation. We study analytically and numerically how the parameters describing the bending impact the primordial fluctuations power spectrum and the mass function of Primordial Black Holes. Our mechanism has the potential of exhibiting unique features accessible to observation through its Primordial Black Hole spectrum and stochastic background of gravitational waves, offering a precious glimpse at the dynamics of inflation in the landscape.

"  We construct novel classes of compact G2 spaces from lifting type IIA flux backgrounds with O6 planes. There exists an extension of IIA Calabi-Yau orientifolds for which some of the D6 branes (required to solve the RR tadpole) are dissolved in $F_2$ fluxes. The backreaction of these fluxes deforms the Calabi-Yau manifold into a specific class of SU(3)-structure manifolds. The lift to M-theory again defines compact G2 manifolds, which in case of toroidal orbifolds are a twisted generalisation of the Joyce construction. This observation also allows a clear identification of the moduli space of a warped compactification with fluxes. We provide a few explicit examples, of which some can be constructed from T-dualising known IIB orientifolds with fluxes. Finally we discuss supersymmetry breaking in this context and suggest that the purely geometric picture in M-theory could provide a simpler setting to address some of the consistency issues of moduli stabilisation and de Sitter uplifting.

"  To best of the authors knowledge, this article presents the first-ever non-invasive glucometer that takes into account serum glucose for high accuracy. In case of blood glucose measurement, serum glucose value has always been considered precise blood glucose value during prandial modes. Serum glucose can be measured in laboratory and more stable glucose level compare to capillary glucose. However, this invasive approach is not convenient for frequent measurement. Sometimes, Conventional invasive blood glucose measurement may be responsible for cause of trauma and chance of blood related infections. To overcome this issue, in the current paper, we propose a novel Internet-of-Medical (IoMT) enabled glucometer for non-invasive precise serum glucose measurement. In this work, a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic technique has been used for glucose measurement. The novel device called iGLU 2.0 is based on optical detection and precise machine learning (ML) regression models. The optimal multiple polynomial regression and deep neural network models have been presented to analyze the precise measurement. The glucose values of serum are saved on cloud through open IoT platform for endocrinologist at remote location. To validate iGLU 2.0, Mean Absolute Relative Difference (mARD) and Average Error (AvgE) are obtained 6.07% and 6.09%, respectively from predicted blood glucose values for capillary glucose. For serum glucose, mARD and AvgE are found 4.86% and 4.88%, respectively. These results represent that the proposed non-invasive glucose measurement device is more precise for serum glucose compared to capillary glucose. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  The short-time Fourier transform (STFT) usually computes the same number of frequency components as the frame length while overlapping adjacent time frames by more than half. As a result, the number of components of a spectrogram matrix becomes more than twice the signal length, and hence STFT is hardly used for signal compression. In addition, even if we modify the spectrogram into a desired one by spectrogram-based signal processing, it is re-changed during the inversion as long as it is outside the range of STFT. In this paper, to reduce the number of components of a spectrogram while maintaining the analytical ability, we propose the frequency-undersampled STFT (FUSTFT), which computes only half the frequency components. We also present the inversions with and without the periodic condition, including their different properties. In simple numerical examples of audio signals, we confirm the validity of FUSTFT and the inversions. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  The computational kernel in solving the $S_N$ transport equations is the parallel sweep, which corresponds to directly inverting a block lower triangular linear system that arises in discretizations of the linear transport equation. Existing parallel sweep algorithms are fairly efficient on structured grids, but still have polynomial scaling, $P^{1/d}$ for $d$ dimensions and $P$ processors. Moreover, an efficient scalable parallel sweep algorithm for use on general unstructured meshes remains elusive. Recently, a classical algebraic multigrid (AMG) method based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR) was developed for nonsymmetric matrices and shown to be an effective solver for linear transport. Motivated by the superior scalability of AMG methods (logarithmic in $P$) as well as the simplicity with which AMG methods can be used in most situations, including on arbitrary unstructured meshes, this paper investigates the use of parallel AIR (pAIR) for solving the $S_N$ transport equations with source iteration in place of parallel sweeps. Results presented in this paper show that pAIR is a robust and scalable solver. Although sweeps are still shown to be much faster than pAIR on a structured mesh of a unit cube, pAIR is shown to perform similarly on both a structured and unstructured mesh, and offers a new, simple, black box alternative to parallel transport sweeps.

"  In this work, we use $N-$body simulations performed on GPU to trace the past 10 Gyr dynamical history of a globular cluster (GC) similar to NGC 6397 in the tidal field of a Milky Way-like galaxy and we compare our simulated GCs with data from the third Gaia early data release. Our simulations predict, in contrast to what is deduced from the data, that such a cluster should present strong and extended tidal tails by more than 6 Gyr ago (right after the first third of its life), exceeding 1 kpc of length, and should be roughly disrupted by current time. We analyzed each of our initial conditions, such as initial mass and density parameters, as well as the dark matter shape, and we argue that the most likely reason for such discrepancy between the data and our simulations is related to the fact that we consider a purely baryonic cluster in the beginning of each model we test. We discuss that if our globular cluster was initially embedded in a dark matter minihalo, the latter could act as a protecting envelope, which prevents the tidal stripping of the luminous matter, while being itself gradually disrupted and removed in the course of the cluster evolution. This could explain why an insignificant amount of dark matter is required to describe the velocity dispersion in NGC 6397, up to at least a few half-mass radii. ",astrophysics

The edge character of a co-exact $p$-form contains characters of anti-symmetric tensors of rank lower to $p$ all the way to the zero-form. Using this result we evaluate the partition function of $p$-forms and demonstrate that they obey known properties under Hodge duality. We show that partition function of conformal forms in even $d+1$ dimensions, on hyperbolic cylinders can be written as integral transforms involving only the bulk characters. This supports earlier observations that entanglement entropy evaluated using partition functions on hyperbolic cylinders do not contain contributions from the edge modes. For conformal coupled scalars we demonstrate that the character integral representation of the free energy on hyperbolic cylinders and branched spheres coincide. Finally we propose a character integral representation for the partition function of $p$-forms on branched spheres. ",high energy physics theory

"  The synchrotron radiation from secondary electrons and positrons (SEPs) generated by hadronic interactions in the shock of supernova remnant (SNR) could be a distinct evidence of cosmic ray (CR) production in SNR shocks. Here we provide a method where the observed gamma-ray flux from SNRs, created by pion decays, is directly used to derive the SEP distribution and hence the synchrotron spectrum. We apply the method to three gamma-ray bright SNRs. In the young SNR RX J1713.7-3946, if the observed GeV-TeV gamma-rays are of hadronic origin and the magnetic field in the SNR shock is $B\gtrsim 0.5$mG, the SEPs may produce a spectral bump at $10^{-5}-10^{-2}$eV, exceeding the predicted synchrotron component of the leptonic model, and a soft spectral tail at $\gtrsim 100$keV, distinct from the hard spectral slope in the leptonic model. In the middle-aged SNRs IC443 and W44, if the observed gamma-rays are of hadronic origin, the SEP synchrotron radiation with $B\sim 400 - 500 \mu$G can well account for the observed radio flux and spectral slopes, supporting the hadronic origin of gamma-rays. Future microwave to far-infrared and hard X-ray (>100keV) observations are encouraged to constraining the SEP radiation and the gamma-ray origin in SNRs. ",astrophysics

Unlike existing subgradient methods, we focus on the case when the exact subgradients of the local objective functions can not be accessed by the agents. To solve this problem, we propose a projected primal-dual dynamics using only the objective function's approximate subgradients. We first prove that the formulated optimization problem can only be solved with an approximate error depending upon the accuracy of the available subgradients. Then, we show the exact solvability of this optimization problem if the accumulated approximation error is not too large. After that, we also give a novel componentwise normalized variant to improve the transient behavior of the convergent sequence. The effectiveness of our algorithms is verified by a numerical example.

"  We provide a spin-adapted formulation of the Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) algorithm, based on the Graphical Unitary Group Approach (GUGA), which enables the exploitation of SU(2) symmetry within this stochastic framework. Random excitation generation and matrix element calculation on the Shavitt graph of GUGA can be efficiently implemented via a biasing procedure on the branching diagram. The use of a spin-pure basis explicitly resolves the different spin-sectors and ensures that the stochastically sampled wavefunction is an eigenfunction of the total spin operator $\hat{\mathbf S}^2$. The method allows for the calculation of states with low or intermediate spin in systems dominated by Hund's first rule, which are otherwise generally inaccessible. Furthermore, in systems with small spin gaps, the new methodology enables much more rapid convergence with respect to walker number and simulation time. Some illustrative applications of the GUGA-FCIQMC method are provided: computation of the $^2F-^4F$ spin gap of the cobalt atom in large basis sets, achieving chemical accuracy to experiment, and the $^1\Sigma_g^+$, $^3\Sigma_g^+$, $^5\Sigma_g^+$, $^7\Sigma_g^+$ spin-gaps of the stretched N$_2$ molecule, an archetypal strongly correlated system.

The proposed theory is non-Hermitian, and we discuss its properties related to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. The calculated correlation functions show a decaying oscillatory behavior related to gapped momentum states. We corroborate this result using path integration.

"  Permeability is the key parameter for quantifying fluid flow in porous rocks. Knowledge of the spatial distribution of the connected pore space allows, in principle, to predict the permeability of a rock sample. However, limitations in feature resolution and approximations at microscopic scales have so far precluded systematic upscaling of permeability predictions. Here, we report fluid flow simulations in capillary network representations designed to overcome such limitations. Performed with an unprecedented level of accuracy in geometric approximation at microscale, the pore scale flow simulations predict experimental permeabilities measured at lab scale in the same rock sample without the need for calibration or correction. By applying the method to a broader class of representative geological samples, with permeability values covering two orders of magnitude, we obtain scaling relationships that reveal how mesoscale permeability emerges from microscopic capillary diameter and fluid velocity distributions.

The main problem we encounter is that in case of non-diagonal scattering the boundary entropy is infinite. We show that this infinity can be cured by a subtraction. The difference of the boundary entropies in the UV and in the IR limits is finite, and matches the known g-functions for the unperturbed $SU(2)_k$ WZNW model for even values of the level.

"  The COVID-19 pandemic led to partial or total lockdowns in several countries during the first half of 2020, which in turn caused a depressed electricity demand. In Great Britain (GB), this low demand combined with large renewable output at times, created conditions that were not expected until renewable capacity increases to meet emissions targets in coming years. The GB system experienced periods of very high instantaneous penetration of non-synchronous renewables, compromising system stability due to the lack of inertia in the grid. In this paper, a detailed analysis of the consequences of the lockdown on the GB electricity system is provided, focusing on the ancillary services procured to guarantee stability. Ancillary-services costs increased by {\pounds}200m in the months of May to July 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 (a threefold increase), highlighting the importance of ancillary services in low-carbon systems. Furthermore, a frequency-secured scheduling model is used in the present paper to showcase the future trends that GB is expected to experience, as penetration of renewables increases on the road to net-zero emissions by 2050.

By comparing the forms of the generating functional $Z$ before and after integrating out the additional field, we derive a set of structural identities which must be satisfied by the Green's functions at all orders. These are distinct from the usual Ward identities, being necessary for the self-consistency of the first order formalism. They relate the Green's functions involving the additional quantum field to those containing a certain composite graviton field, which corresponds to its classical value. Thereby, the structural identities lead to a simple interpretation of the auxiliary field. ",high energy physics theory

"  Physicists have speculated about the properties of the quantum vacuum for at least 85 years; however, only recently have they understood the quantum vacuum sufficiently well to begin making testable predictions. Specifically, using Maxwell's equations to describe the interaction of the electromagnetic field with charged lepton - antilepton vacuum fluctuations, it has been possible to calculate the permittivity of the vacuum, the speed of light in the vacuum, and the fine structure constant. Physicists are now also beginning to successfully address problems in cosmology based on properties of the quantum vacuum. The terms ``vacuum catastrophe'' and ``old cosmological problem'' refer, respectively, to the predictions that the vacuum energy density and the cosmological constant are both approximately 120 orders of magnitude larger than the observed values. Using properties of the quantum vacuum and well-established physics, it is possible to demonstrate that the huge vacuum energy cannot transfer energy to normal matter; accordingly, vacuum energy contributes neither to the observed energy density of the universe nor to the cosmological constant, which plays a central role in the accelerating expansion of the universe.

"  Multistatic radar system (MSRS) is considered an effective scheme to suppress mainlobe jamming, since it has higher spatial resolution enabling jamming cancellation from spatial domain.

We study the covariance matrix of jamming signals received by radars, and derive its rank, revealing that the covariance matrix is of full rank. We also calculate the output jamming to signal and noise ratio (JSNR) after the subspace-based jamming suppression methods used in MSRS under the proposed jamming method, which demonstrates that the full rank property invalidates such suppression methods.

"  The spectral gap problem - determining whether the energy spectrum of a system has an energy gap above ground state, or if there is a continuous range of low-energy excitations - pervades quantum many-body physics. Recently, this important problem was shown to be undecidable for quantum spin systems in two (or more) spatial dimensions: there exists no algorithm that determines in general whether a system is gapped or gapless, a result which has many unexpected consequences for the physics of such systems. However, there are many indications that one dimensional spin systems are simpler than their higher-dimensional counterparts: for example, they cannot have thermal phase transitions or topological order, and there exist highly-effective numerical algorithms such as DMRG - and even provably polynomial-time ones - for gapped 1D systems, exploiting the fact that such systems obey an entropy area-law. Furthermore, the spectral gap undecidability construction crucially relied on aperiodic tilings, which are not possible in 1D.   So does the spectral gap problem become decidable in 1D? In this paper we prove this is not the case, by constructing a family of 1D spin chains with translationally-invariant nearest neighbour interactions for which no algorithm can determine the presence of a spectral gap. This not only proves that the spectral gap of 1D systems is just as intractable as in higher dimensions, but also predicts the existence of qualitatively new types of complex physics in 1D spin chains. In particular, it implies there are 1D systems with constant spectral gap and non-degenerate classical ground state for all systems sizes up to an uncomputably large size, whereupon they switch to a gapless behaviour with dense spectrum.

The M5-brane theory describes self-interactions of an abelian tensor supermultiplet with $(2,0)$ supersymmetry, and the tree-level superamplitudes are given by a twistor formula. We apply the construction to the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes in the D3-brane theory at one-loop order, which are purely rational terms (except for the four-point amplitude). The results are further confirmed by generalised unitarity methods.

"  This paper provides a new solution approach to a multi-player perimeter defense game, in which the intruders' team tries to enter the territory, and a team of defenders protects the territory by capturing intruders on the perimeter of the territory. The objective of the defenders is to detect and capture the intruders before the intruders enter the territory. Each defender independently senses the intruder and computes his trajectory to capture the assigned intruders in a cooperative fashion. The intruder is estimated to reach a specific location on the perimeter at a specific time. Each intruder is viewed as a spatio-temporal task, and the defenders are assigned to execute these spatio-temporal tasks. At any given time, the perimeter defense problem is converted into a Decentralized Multi-UAV Spatio-Temporal Multi-Task Allocation (DMUST-MTA) problem. The cost of executing a task for a trajectory is defined by a composite cost function of both the spatial and temporal components. In this paper, a decentralized consensus-based bundle algorithm has been modified to solve the spatio-temporal multi-task allocation problem, and the performance evaluation of the proposed approach is carried out based on Monte-Carlo simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to solve the perimeter defense game under different scenarios. Performance comparison with a state-of-the-art centralized approach with full observability, clearly indicates that DMUST-MTA achieves similar performance in a decentralized way with partial observability conditions with a lesser computational time and easy scaling up.

"  In this paper, we explore the mechanisms that regulate the formation and evolution of stellar black hole binaries (BHBs) around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We show that dynamical interactions can efficiently drive ""in-situ"" BHB formation if the SMBH is surrounded by a massive nuclear cluster (NC), while orbitally segregated star clusters can replenish the BHB reservoir in SMBH-dominated nuclei. We discuss how the combined action of stellar hardening and mass segregation sculpts the BHB orbital properties. We use direct N-body simulations including post-Newtonian corrections up to 2.5 order to study the BHB-SMBH interplay, showing that the Kozai-Lidov mechanism plays a crucial role in shortening binaries lifetime. We find that the merging probability weakly depends on the SMBH mass in the $10^6-10^9{\rm ~M}_\odot$ mass range, leading to a merger rate $\Gamma \simeq 3-8$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ at redshift zero. Nearly $40\%$ of the mergers have masses in the ""BH mass gap"", $50-140{\rm ~M}_\odot$, thus indicating that galactic nuclei are ideal places to form BHs in this mass range. We argue that gravitational wave (GW) sources with components mass $m_1>40{\rm ~M}_\odot$ and $m_2<30{\rm ~M}_\odot$ would represent a strong indicator of a galactic nuclei origin.

"  We present a new, multi-dimensional implementation of the Advanced Spectral Leakage (ASL) scheme with the purpose of modelling neutrino-matter interactions in neutron star mergers. A major challenge is the neutrino absorption in the semi-transparent regime, which is responsible for driving winds from the merger remnant. The composition of such winds is crucial in the understanding of the electromagnetic emission in the recently observed macronova following GW170817. Compared to the original version, we introduce an optical-depth-dependent flux factor to model the average angle of neutrino propagation, and a modulation that accounts for flux anisotropies in non-spherical geometries. We scrutinise our approach by first comparing the new scheme against the original one for a spherically symmetric core-collapse supernova snapshot, both in 1D and in 3D, and additionally against a two-moment (M1) scheme as implemented in 1D into the code GR1D. The luminosities and mean energies agree to a few percents in most tests. Finally, for the case of a binary merger remnant snapshot we compare the new ASL scheme with the M1 scheme that is implemented in the Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH. We find that the neutrino absorption distribution in the semi-transparent regime is overall well reproduced. Both approaches agree to within $\lesssim 15\%$ for the average energies and to better than $\sim 35 \%$ in the total luminosities. ",astrophysics
"  This paper proposes a learning reference governor (LRG) approach to enforce state and control constraints in systems for which an accurate model is unavailable; and this approach enables the reference governor to gradually improve command tracking performance through learning while enforcing the constraints during learning and after learning is completed. The learning can be performed either on a black-box type model of the system or directly on the hardware. After introducing the LRG algorithm and outlining its theoretical properties, this paper investigates LRG application to fuel truck rollover avoidance. Through simulations based on a fuel truck model that accounts for liquid fuel sloshing effects, we show that the proposed LRG can effectively protect fuel trucks from rollover accidents under various operating conditions.

"  This paper deals with the impulsive formation control of spacecraft in the presence of constraints on the position vector and time. Determining a set of path constraints can increase the safety and reliability in an impulsive relative motion of spacecraft. Specially, the feasibility problem of the position norm constraints is considered in this paper. Under assumptions, it is proved that if a position vector be reachable, then the reach time and the corresponding time of impulses are unique. The trajectory boundedness of the spacecraft between adjacent impulses are analyzed using the Gerschgorin and the RayleighRitz theorems as well as a finite form of the Jensen's inequality. Some boundaries are introduced regarding the Jordan-Brouwer separation theorem which are useful in checking the satisfaction of a constraint. Two numerical examples (approximate circular formation keeping and collision-free maneuver) are solved in order to show the applications and visualize the results. ",mathematics
"  We demonstrate an unsuspected freedom in physics, by showing an essential unpredictability in the relation between the behavior of clocks on the workbench and explanations of that behavior written in symbols on the blackboard. In theory, time and space are defined by clocks synchronized as specified by relations among clock readings at the transmission and reception of light signals; however spacetime curvature implies obstacles to this synchronization. Recognizing the need to handle bits and other symbols in both theory and experiment, we offer a novel theory of symbol handling, centered on a kind of ""logical synchronization,"" distinct from the synchronization defined by Einstein in special relativity.   We present three things: (1) We show a need in physics, stemming from general relativity, for physicists to make choices about what clocks to synchronize with what other clocks. (2) To exploit the capacity to make choices of synchronization, we provide a theory in which to express timing relations between transmitted symbols and the clock readings of the agent that receives them, without relying on any global concept of ""time"". Dispensing with a global time variable is a marked departure from current practice. (3) The recognition of unpredictability calls for more attention to behavior on the workbench of experiment relative to what can be predicted on the blackboard. As a prime example, we report on the ""horse race"" situation of an agent measuring the order of arrival of two symbols, to show how order determinations depart from any possible assignment of values of a time variable.

"  Dirac particle represents a fundamental constituent of our nature. Simulation of Dirac particle dynamics by a controllable quantum system using quantum walks will allow us to investigate the non-classical nature of dynamics in its discrete form. In this work, starting from a modified version of one-spatial dimensional general inhomogeneous split-step discrete quantum walk we derive an effective Hamiltonian which mimics a single massive Dirac particle dynamics in curved $(1+1)$ space-time dimension coupled to $U(1)$ gauge potential---which is a forward step towards the simulation of the unification of electromagnetic and gravitational forces in lower dimension and at the single particle level. Implementation of this simulation scheme in simple qubit-system has been demonstrated. We show that the same Hamiltonian can represent $(2+1)$ space-time dimensional Dirac particle dynamics when one of the spatial momenta remains fixed. We also discuss how we can include $U(N)$ gauge potential in our scheme, in order to capture other fundamental force effects on the Dirac particle. The emergence of curvature in the two-particle split-step quantum walk has also been investigated while the particles are interacting through their entangled coin operations. ",quantum physics
"  Demand response (DR) programs are interesting ways to attract consumers' participation in order to improve the electric consumption patterns. DR programs motivate customers to change the consumption patterns in response to price changes. This could be done by paying incentives or considering penalties either when wholesale market prices are high or when network reliability is at risk. The overall purpose of implementing DR programs is to improve the network reliability and reduce the costs. Successful implementation of these programs requires prerequisites, which without them, there is no guarantee of the success of these programs. Different sciences have proposed various scientific solutions for creating optimal power consumption behavior in customers, such as solutions based on the technical and economic aspects. Although each of these solutions might be efficient and effective, they could not cover all the aspects of the solutions. The results of studies conducted by many researchers show that in addition to the technical and economic issues, social, cultural, and behavioral factors are also very important. Therefore, in this paper, cultural, social, and behavioral aspects are investigated and analyzed as one of the vital requirements for better implementation of DR. ",physics
"  The term `resilience' is increasingly being used in the domain of social-technical-environmental systems science and related fields. However, the diversity of resilience concepts and a certain (sometimes intended) openness of proposed definitions can lead to misunderstandings and impede their application to systems modelling. We propose an approach that aims to ease communication as well as to support systematic development of research questions and models in the context of resilience. It can be applied independently of the modelling framework or underlying theory of choice. At the heart of this guideline is a checklist consisting of four questions to be answered: (i) Resilience of what? (ii) Resilience regarding what? (iii) Resilience against what? (iv) Resilience how? We refer to the answers to these resilience questions as the ""system"", the ""sustainant"", the ""adverse influence"", and the ""response options"". The term `sustainant' is a neologism describing the feature of the system (state, structure, function, pathway etc.) that should be maintained (or restored quickly enough) in order to call the system resilient.   The use of this proposed guideline is demonstrated for two application examples: fisheries, and the Amazon rainforest. The examples illustrate the diversity of possible answers to the checklist's questions as well as their benefits in structuring the modelling process. The guideline supports the modeller in communicating precisely what is actually meant by `resilience' in a specific context. This combination of freedom and precision could help to advance the resilience discourse by building a bridge between those demanding unambiguous definitions and those stressing the benefits of generality and flexibility of the resilience concept.

"  In this paper, we investigate estimators for symmetric $\alpha$-stable CARMA processes sampled equidistantly. Simulation studies suggest that the Whittle estimator and the estimator presented in Garc\'{\i}a et al. (2011) are consistent estimators for the parameters of stable CARMA processes. For CARMA processes with finite second moments it is well-known that the Whittle estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Therefore, in the light-tailed setting the properties of the Whittle estimator for CARMA processes are similar to those of the Whittle estimator for ARMA processes. However, in the present paper we prove that, in general, the Whittle estimator for symmetric $\alpha$-stable CARMA processes sampled at low frequencies is not consistent and highlight why simulation studies suggest something else. Thus, in contrast to the light-tailed setting the properties of the Whittle estimator for heavy-tailed ARMA processes can not be transferred to heavy-tailed CARMA processes. We elaborate as well that the estimator presented in Garc\'{\i}a et al. (2011) faces the same problems. However, the Whittle estimator for stable CAR(1) processes is consistent. ",mathematics

"  Planning of radiotherapy involves accurate segmentation of a large number of organs at risk, i.e. organs for which irradiation doses should be minimized to avoid important side effects of the therapy. We propose a deep learning method for segmentation of organs at risk inside the brain region, from Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. Our system performs segmentation of eight structures: eye, lens, optic nerve, optic chiasm, pituitary gland, hippocampus, brainstem and brain. We propose an efficient algorithm to train neural networks for an end-to-end segmentation of multiple and non-exclusive classes, addressing problems related to computational costs and missing ground truth segmentations for a subset of classes. We enforce anatomical consistency of the result in a postprocessing step, in particular we introduce a graph-based algorithm for segmentation of the optic nerves, enforcing the connectivity between the eyes and the optic chiasm. We report cross-validated quantitative results on a database of 44 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRIs with provided segmentations of the considered organs at risk, which were originally used for radiotherapy planning. In addition, the segmentations produced by our model on an independent test set of 50 MRIs are evaluated by an experienced radiotherapist in order to qualitatively assess their accuracy. The mean distances between produced segmentations and the ground truth ranged from 0.1 mm to 0.7 mm across different organs. A vast majority (96 %) of the produced segmentations were found acceptable for radiotherapy planning. ",electrical engineering and systems science

We theoretically show that the separation can be large under certain conditions without losing the spectral efficiency (SE). Our numerical results show that the IS combined ML and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)-based estimators can provide approximately 3 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain in some cases while improving estimation accuracy substantially without causing any bit-error ratio (BER) degradation at the communication receiver.

"  Tensor models admit the large $N$ limit dominated by the graphs called melons. The melons are caracterized by the Gurau number $\varpi=0$ and the amplitude of the Feynman graphs are proportional to $N^{-\varpi}$. Other leading order contributions i.e. $\varpi> 0$ called pseudo-melons can be taken into account in the renormalization program. The following paper deals with the renormalization group for a $U(1)$-tensorial group field theory model taking into account these two sectors (melon and pseudo-melon). It generalizes a recent work [arXiv:1803.09902], in which only the melonic sector have been studied. Using the power counting theorem the divergent graphs of the model are identified. Also, the effective vertex expansion is used to generate in detail the combinatorial analysis of these two leading order sectors.

"  We explore whether non-standard dark sector physics might be required to solve the existing cosmological tensions. The properties we consider in combination are an interaction between the dark matter and dark energy components, and a dark energy equation of state $w$ different from that of the canonical cosmological constant $w=-1$. In principle, these two parameters are independent. In practice, to avoid early-time, superhorizon instabilities, their allowed parameter spaces are correlated. We analyze three classes of extended interacting dark energy models in light of the 2019 Planck CMB results and Cepheid-calibrated local distance ladder $H_0$ measurements of Riess et al. (R19), as well as recent BAO and SNeIa distance data. We find that in quintessence coupled dark energy models, where $w > -1$, the evidence for a non-zero coupling between the two dark sectors can surpass the $5\sigma$ significance. On the other hand, in phantom coupled dark energy models, there is no such preference for a non-zero dark sector coupling. All the models we consider significantly raise the value of the Hubble constant easing the $H_0$ tension. The addition of low-redshift BAO and SNeIa measurements leaves some residual tension with R19 but at a level that could be justified by a statistical fluctuation. Bayesian evidence considerations mildly disfavour both the coupled quintessence and phantom models, while mildly favouring a coupled vacuum scenario, even when late-time datasets are considered. We conclude that non-minimal dark energy cosmologies, such as coupled quintessence, phantom, or vacuum models, are still an interesting route towards softening existing cosmological tensions, even when low-redshift datasets and Bayesian evidence considerations are taken into account.

"  We introduce a novel deep-learning architecture for image upscaling by large factors (e.g. 4x, 8x) based on examples of pristine high-resolution images. Our target is to reconstruct high-resolution images from their downscale versions. The proposed system performs a multi-level progressive upscaling, starting from small factors (2x) and updating for higher factors (4x and 8x). The system is recursive as it repeats the same procedure at each level. It is also residual since we use the network to update the outputs of a classic upscaler. The network residuals are improved by Iterative Back-Projections (IBP) computed in the features of a convolutional network. To work in multiple levels we extend the standard back-projection algorithm using a recursion analogous to Multi-Grid algorithms commonly used as solvers of large systems of linear equations. We finally show how the network can be interpreted as a standard upsampling-and-filter upscaler with a space-variant filter that adapts to the geometry. This approach allows us to visualize how the network learns to upscale. Finally, our system reaches state of the art quality for models with relatively few number of parameters.

"  In this paper, we mathematically construct wavelet eigenanalysis in high dimensions (Abry and Didier (2018a, 2018b)) by characterizing the scaling behavior of the eigenvalues of large wavelet random matrices.

We show that the $r$ largest eigenvalues of the wavelet random matrices, when appropriately rescaled, converge to scale invariant functions in the high-dimensional limit. By contrast, the remaining $p-r$ eigenvalues remain bounded. In addition, we show that, up to a log transformation, the $r$ largest eigenvalues of wavelet random matrices exhibit asymptotically Gaussian distributions. We further show how the asymptotic and large-scale behavior of wavelet eigenvalues can be used to construct statistical inference methodology for a high-dimensional signal-plus-noise system.

"  Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy for treatment of the disease has been failing to reach diabetic people living in rural areas. Shortage of trained ophthalmologists, limited availability of healthcare centers, and expensiveness of diagnostic equipment are among the reasons.

"  The main concern of this paper is how to define proper measures of multipartite entanglement for mixed quantum states. Since the structure of partial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if the number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an ultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the rich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order structure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps towards this direction.   First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability classification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A 86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the entanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different kinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of the partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this structure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be mapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.   Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that a given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of entanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement classes. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and propose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite generalization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement entropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The multipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to consider the measures to be the different manifestations of some ""unified"" notion of entanglement. ",quantum physics

"  It is demonstrated that the generic four-dimensional Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino (Taub-NUT) spacetimes can be perfectly described in terms of three or four different kinds of thermodynamic hairs: the Komar mass ($M = m$), the ""angular momentum"" ($J_n = mn$), the gravitomagnetic charge ($N = n$), and/or the dual (magnetic) mass ($\widetilde{M} = n$). In other words, the NUT charge is a thermodynamic multihair which means that it simultaneously has both rotation-like and electromagnetic charge-like characteristics; this is in sharp contrast with the previous knowledge that it has only one physical feature, or that it is purely a single solution parameter. To arrive at this novel result, we put forward a simple, systematic way to investigate the consistent thermodynamic first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formulas of all four-dimensional spacetimes that contain a nonzero NUT charge, facilitated by first deriving a meaningful Christodoulou-Ruffini-type squared-mass formula. In this way, not only can the elegant Bekenstein-Hawking one-quarter area-entropy relation be naturally restored in the Lorentzian and Euclidian sectors of generic Taub-NUT-type spacetimes without imposing any constraint condition, but also the physical meaning of the NUT parameter as a poly-facet can be completely clarified in the thermodynamic sense for the first time.

"  With the recent trend for ultra high definition displays, the demand for high quality and efficient video super-resolution (VSR) has become more important than ever. Previous methods adopt complex motion compensation strategies to exploit temporal information when estimating the missing high frequency details. However, as the motion estimation problem is a highly challenging problem, inaccurate motion compensation may affect the performance of VSR algorithms. Furthermore, the complex motion compensation module may also introduce a heavy computational burden, which limits the application of these methods in real systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient recurrent latent space propagation (RLSP) algorithm for fast VSR. RLSP introduces high-dimensional latent states to propagate temporal information between frames in an implicit manner.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the source in quiescence that allow us to reveal the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion star and absorption features consistent with those of an early K-type star (Teff = 4610 +130 -160 K). The central wavelengths of the absorption lines vary periodically at Porb = 0.394 +- 0.004 d with an amplitude of K2 = 554 +- 8 km/s . They imply a mass function for the compact object of f(M1) = 6.9 +- 0.3 Msun, confirming its black hole nature. The simultaneous absence of X-ray eclipses and the presence of dips set a conservative range of allowed inclinations 60 deg < i < 82 deg, while modelling of optical light curves further constrain it to i = 72 +5 -8 deg. The above parameters together set a black hole mass of M1 = 8.9 +1.6 -1.0 Msun and a companion mass of M2=0.43 +- 0.16 Msun, much lower than that of a dwarf star of the observed spectral type, implying it is evolved. Estimates of the distance to the system (d = 7.5 +1.8 -1.4 kpc) and space velocity (vspace = 270 +- 60 km/s ) place it in the Galactic thick disc and favour a strong natal kick during the formation of the BH if the supernova occurred in the Galactic Plane.

"  Here we present an analysis of the mobility-limiting mechanisms of a two-dimensional hole gas on hydrogen-terminated diamond surfaces. The scattering rates of surface impurities, surface roughness, non-polar optical phonons, and acoustic phonons are included. Using a Schrodinger/Poisson solver, the heavy hole, light hole, and split-off bands are treated separately. To compare the calculations with experimental data, Hall-effect structures were fabricated and measured at temperatures ranging from 25 to 700 K, with hole sheet densities ranging from 2 to 6$\times10^{12}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$ and typical mobilities measured from 60 to 100 cm$^{2}$/(V$\cdot$s) at room temperature. Existing data from literature was also used, which spans sheet densities above 1$\times10^{13}\;\text{cm}^{-2}$. Our analysis indicates that for low sheet densities, surface impurity scattering by charged acceptors and surface roughness are not sufficient to account for the low mobility. Moreover, the experimental data suggests that long-range potential fluctuations exist at the diamond surface, and are particularly enhanced at lower sheet densities. Thus, we propose a second type of surface impurity scattering which is caused by disorder related to the C-H dipoles. ",physics

"  This work presents a parametrized family of distances, namely the Alpha Procrustes distances, on the set of symmetric, positive definite (SPD) matrices. The Alpha Procrustes distances provide a unified formulation encompassing both the Bures-Wasserstein and Log-Euclidean distances between SPD matrices. We show that the Alpha Procrustes distances are the Riemannian distances corresponding to a family of Riemannian metrics on the manifold of SPD matrices, which encompass both the Log-Euclidean and Wasserstein Riemannian metrics. This formulation is then generalized to the set of positive definite Hilbert-Schmidt operators on a Hilbert space, unifying the infinite-dimensional Bures-Wasserstein and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. In the setting of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) covariance operators, we obtain closed form formulas for all the distances via the corresponding kernel Gram matrices. From a statistical viewpoint, the Alpha Procrustes distances give rise to a parametrized family of distances between Gaussian measures on Euclidean space, in the finite-dimensional case, and separable Hilbert spaces, in the infinite-dimensional case, encompassing the 2-Wasserstein distance, with closed form formulas via Gram matrices in the RKHS setting.

This phenomenon is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. In these lecture notes, starting from a careful definition of symmetry in physics, we introduce symmetry breaking and its consequences. Emphasis is placed on the physics of singular limits, showing the reality of symmetry breaking even in small-sized systems. Topics covered include Nambu-Goldstone modes, quantum corrections, phase transitions, topological defects and gauge fields. We provide many examples from both high energy and condensed matter physics. These notes are suitable for graduate students. ",high energy physics theory
"  In a recent paper we developed a string cosmology background from classical string geometry. Here, we show that this background yields a solution to the size and horizon problems of Standard Big Bang cosmology while remaining compatible with the Transplanckian Censorship Conjecture.

"  The present study experimentally and numerically investigates the evaporation and resultant patterns of dried deposits of aqueous colloidal sessile droplets, when the droplets are initially elevated to a high temperature before being placed on a substrate held at ambient temperature. The system is then released for natural evaporation without applying any external perturbation. Infrared thermography and optical profilometry were used as essential tools for interfacial temperature measurements and quantification of the coffee-ring dimensions, respectively. Initially, a significant temperature gradient exists along the liquid-gas interface as soon as the droplet is deposited on the substrate which triggers a Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow directed from the top of the droplet towards the contact line along the liquid-gas interface. Thus, the flow is in the reverse direction to that seen in the conventional substrate heating case. Interestingly, this temperature gradient decays rapidly -- within the first 10% of the total evaporation time and the droplet-substrate system reaches thermal equilibrium with ambient thereafter. Despite fast decay of the temperature gradient, the coffee-ring dimensions significantly diminish, leading to an inner deposit. This suppression of the coffee-ring effect is attributed to the fact that the initial Marangoni stress-induced recirculation flow continues until the last stage of the evaporation, even after the interfacial temperature gradient vanishes. This is essentially a consequence of liquid inertia. Overall, together with a new experimental condition, the present investigation discloses a distinct nature of Marangoni stress-induced flow in the drying droplet and its role in influencing the associated colloidal deposits, which was not explored previously.

"  The adverse effects of sea water environment on the fatigue life of woven carbon fiber/vinyl ester composites are established at room temperature in view of long-term survivability of offshore structures. It is observed that the influence of sea water saturation on the fatigue life is more pronounced when the maximum cyclic displacement approaches maximum quasi-static deflection, that is, the reduction in the number of cycles to failure are comparable between dry and sea water saturated samples at lower strain ranges (~37% at 0.46% strain), but are drastically different at higher strain ranges (~90% at 0.62% strain). Key damage modes that manifest during the fatigue loading is also identified, and a non-linear model is established for predicting low cycle fatigue life of these composites in dry and sea water saturated conditions.

"  We investigate a no-boarding policy in a system of $N$ buses serving $M$ bus stops in a loop, which is an entrainment mechanism to keep buses synchronised in a reasonably staggered configuration. Buses always allow alighting, but would disallow boarding if certain criteria are met. For an analytically tractable theory, buses move with the same natural speed (applicable to programmable self-driving buses), where the average waiting time experienced by passengers waiting at the bus stop for a bus to arrive can be calculated. The analytical results show that a no-boarding policy can dramatically reduce the average waiting time, as compared to the usual situation without the no-boarding policy. Subsequently, we carry out simulations to verify these theoretical analyses, also extending the simulations to typical human-driven buses with different natural speeds based on real data. Finally, a simple general adaptive algorithm is implemented to dynamically determine when to implement no-boarding in a simulation for a real university shuttle bus service. ",physics

Using the spherical symmetry of the black holes and gauge symmetry, we show the $p$-form field can be expressed in terms of the coexact $p$-form and the coexact $(p-1)$-form on the sphere $S^{D-2}$. These variables allow us to find the master equations. By utilizing the S-deformation method, we explicitly show the stability of $p$-form fields in the spherical black hole spacetime. Moreover, using the WKB approximation, we calculate the quasinormal modes of the $p$-form fields in $D(\leq10)$-dimensions. ",high energy physics theory

In type A, we apply these techniques to prove a support theorem for the universal family of Hessenberg varieties. We also observe that the recent results of Brosnan and Chow, which apply the local invariant cycle theorem to the family of regular Hessenberg varieties in type A, extend to arbitrary Lie type. We use this extension to prove that regular Hessenberg varieties, though not necessarily smooth, always have the ""Kahler package"". ",mathematics
"  Schwarzschild black-hole interiors border on space-like singularities representing classical information leaks. We show that local quantum physics is decoupled from these leaks due to dynamically generated boundaries, called Zeno borders. Beyond Zeno borders black-hole interiors become asymptotically silent, and quantum fields evolve freely towards the geodesic singularity with vanishing probability measure for populating the geodesic boundary. Thus Zeno borders represent a probabilistic completion of Schwarzschild black holes within the semiclassical framework. ",high energy physics theory
"  We study cosmological inflation within a recently proposed framework of perturbative moduli stabilisation in type IIB/F theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The stabilisation mechanism utilises three stacks of magnetised 7-branes and relies on perturbative corrections to the K\""ahler potential that grow logarithmically in the transverse sizes of co-dimension two due to local tadpoles of closed string states in the bulk. The inflaton is the K\""ahler modulus associated with the internal compactification volume that starts rolling down the scalar potential from an initial condition around its maximum. Although the parameter space allows moduli stabilisation in de Sitter space, the resulting number of e-foldings is too low. An extra uplifting source of the vacuum energy is then required to achieve phenomenologically viable inflation and a positive (although tiny) vacuum energy at the minimum. Here we use, as an example, a new Fayet-Iliopoulos term proposed recently in supergravity that can be written for a non R-symmetry U(1) and is gauge invariant at the Lagrangian level; its possible origin though in string theory remains an open interesting problem.

"  Must a theory of quantum gravity have some truth to it if it can recover general relativity in some limit of the theory? This paper answers this question in the negative by indicating that general relativity is multiply realizable in quantum gravity. The argument is inspired by spacetime functionalism - multiple realizability being a central tenet of functionalism - and proceeds via three case studies: induced gravity, thermodynamic gravity, and entanglement gravity. In these, general relativity in the form of the Einstein field equations can be recovered from elements that are either manifestly multiply realizable or at least of the generic nature that is suggestive of functions. If general relativity, as argued here, can inherit this multiple realizability, then a theory of quantum gravity can recover general relativity while being completely wrong about the posited microstructure. As a consequence, the recovery of general relativity cannot serve as the ultimate arbiter that decides which theory of quantum gravity that is worthy of pursuit, even though it is of course not irrelevant either qua quantum gravity. Thus, the recovery of general relativity in string theory, for instance, does not guarantee that the stringy account of the world is on the right track; despite sentiments to the contrary among string theorists.

More precisely, we derive a fully explicit formula for the leading order asymptotics for the tail probability and demonstrate a new universality phenomenon. Our analysis here shares similar philosophy with the subcritical case but requires a different approach due to complications in the analogous localisation step, and we also employ techniques from recent studies of fusion estimates in GMC theory.

"  The Parker Solar Probe was launched on 2018 August 12 and completed its second orbit on 2019 June 19 with perihelion of 35.7 solar radii. During this time, the Energetic particle Instrument-Hi (EPI-Hi, one of the two energetic particle instruments comprising the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun, ISOIS) measured seven proton intensity increases associated with stream interaction regions (SIRs), two of which appear to be occurring in the same region corotating with the Sun. The events are relatively weak, with observed proton spectra extending to only a few MeV and lasting for a few days. The proton spectra are best characterized by power laws with indices ranging from -4.3 to -6.5, generally softer than events associated with SIRs observed at 1 au and beyond. Helium spectra were also obtained with similar indices, allowing He/H abundance ratios to be calculated for each event. We find values of 0.016-0.031, which are consistent with ratios obtained previously for corotating interaction region events with fast solar wind < 600 km s-1. Using the observed solar wind data combined with solar wind simulations, we study the solar wind structures associated with these events and identify additional spacecraft near 1 au appropriately positioned to observe the same structures after some corotation. Examination of the energetic particle observations from these spacecraft yields two events that may correspond to the energetic particle increases seen by EPI-Hi earlier. ",physics
"  We study the algebraic properties of binary relations whose underlying digraph is smooth, that is has no source or sink. Such objects have been studied as surjective hyper-operations (shops) on the corresponding vertex set, and as binary relations that are defined everywhere and whose inverse is also defined everywhere. In the latter formulation, they have been called multipermutations. We study the lattice structure of sets (monoids) of multipermutations over an n-element domain. Through a Galois connection, these monoids form the algebraic counterparts to sets of relations closed under definability in positive first-order logic without equality. The first side of this Galois connection has been elaborated previously, we show the other side here. We study the property of inverse on multipermutations and how it connects our monoids to groups. We use our results to give a simple dichotomy theorem for the evaluation problem of positive first-order logic without equality on the class of structures whose preserving multipermutations form a monoid closed under inverse. These problems turn out either to be in Logspace or to be Pspace-complete. We go on to study the monoid of all multipermutations on an n-element domain, under usual composition of relations. We characterise its Green relations, regular elements and show that it does not admit a generating set that is polynomial on n. ",mathematics
"  We introduce log-log convex programs, which are optimization problems with positive variables that become convex when the variables, objective functions, and constraint functions are replaced with their logs, which we refer to as a log-log transformation. This class of problems generalizes traditional geometric programming and generalized geometric programming, and it includes interesting problems involving nonnegative matrices. We give examples of log-log convex functions, some well-known and some less so, and we develop an analog of disciplined convex programming, which we call disciplined geometric programming. Disciplined geometric programming is a subclass of log-log convex programming generated by a composition rule and a set of functions with known curvature under the log-log transformation. Finally, we describe an implementation of disciplined geometric programming as a reduction in CVXPY 1.0. ",mathematics
"  A number of open problems hinder our present ability to extract scientific information from data that will be gathered by the near-future gravitational-wave mission LISA. Many of these relate to the modeling, detection and characterization of signals from binary inspirals with an extreme component-mass ratio of $\lesssim10^{-4}$. In this paper, we draw attention to the issue of systematic error in parameter estimation due to the use of fast but approximate waveform models; this is found to be relevant for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals even in the case of waveforms with $\gtrsim90\%$ overlap accuracy and moderate ($\gtrsim30$) signal-to-noise ratios. A scheme that uses Gaussian processes to interpolate and marginalize over waveform error is adapted and investigated as a possible precursor solution to this problem. Several new methodological results are obtained, and the viability of the technique is successfully demonstrated on a three-parameter example in the setting of the LISA Data Challenge. ",astrophysics
"  At one loop, quantum kinks are described by a sum of quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonians, and so their spectra are known exactly. We find the first correction beyond one loop to the quantum states corresponding to kinks with an excited bound or unbound normal mode, and also the corresponding two-loop correction to the energy cost of exciting the normal mode. In the case of unbound normal modes, this correction is equal to sum of the corresponding nonrelativistic kinetic energy plus the usual one-loop correction to the mass of the corresponding plane wave in the absence of a kink. We also sketch a diagrammatic method for such calculations. ",high energy physics theory

"  This study addresses incident handling during an adverse event for dynamical networked control systems. Incident handling can be divided into five steps: detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. For networked control systems, the containment step can be conducted through physical disconnection of an attacked subsystem. In accordance with the disconnection, the equipped attack detection unit should be reconfigured to maintain its detection capability. In particular, separating the detection subunit associated with the disconnected subsystem is considered as a specific reconfiguration scheme in this study. This paper poses the problem of disconnection-aware attack detection and isolation with the separation-based detector reconfiguration. The objective is to find an attack detection unit that preserves its detection and isolation capability even under any possible disconnection and separation. The difficulty arises from network topology variation caused by disconnection that can possibly lead to stability loss of the distributed observer inside the attack detection unit. A solution is proposed based on an existing controller design technique referred to as retrofit control. Furthermore, an application to low-voltage power distribution networks with distributed generation is exhibited. Numerical examples evidence the practical use of the proposed method through a benchmark distribution network. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  We run three long-timescale general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto non-rotating black holes. Our aim is to achieve steady-state behavior out to large radii and understand the resulting flow structure. A simulation with adiabatic index Gamma = 4/3 and small initial alternating poloidal magnetic field loops is run to a time of 440,000 GM/c^3, reaching inflow equilibrium inside a radius of 370 GM/c^2. Variations with larger alternating field loops and with Gamma = 5/3 are run to 220,000 GM/c^3, attaining equilibrium out to 170 GM/c^2 and 440 GM/c^2. There is no universal self-similar behavior obtained at radii in inflow equilibrium: the Gamma = 5/3 simulation shows a radial density profile with power law index ranging from -1 in the inner regions to -1/2 in the outer regions, while the others have a power-law slope ranging from -1/2 to close to -2. Both simulations with small field loops reach a state with polar inflow of matter, while the more ordered initial field has polar outflows. However, unbound outflows remove only a factor of order unity of the inflowing material over a factor of ~300 in radius. Our results suggest that the dynamics of radiatively inefficient accretion flows are sensitive to how the flow is fed from larger radii, and may differ appreciably in different astrophysical systems. Millimeter images appropriate for Sgr A* are qualitatively (but not quantitatively) similar in all simulations, with a prominent asymmetric image due to Doppler boosting. ",astrophysics
"  Peer influence and social contagion are key denominators in the adoption and participation of information spreading, such as news propagation, word-of-mouth or viral marketing. In this study, we argue that it is biased to only focus on the scale and coverage of information spreading, and propose that the level of influence reinforcement, quantified by the re-exposure rate, i.e., the rate of individuals who are repeatedly exposed to the same information, should be considered together to measure the effectiveness of spreading. We show that local network structural characteristics significantly affects the probability of being exposed or re-exposed to the same information. After analyzing trending news on the super large-scale online network of Sina Weibo (China's Twitter) with 430 million connected users, we find a class of users with extremely low exposure rate, even they are following tens of thousands of others; and the re-exposure rate is substantially higher for news with more transmission waves and stronger secondary forwarding. While exposure and re-exposure rate typically grow together with the scale of spreading, we find exceptional cases where it is possible to achieve a high exposure rate while maintaining low re-exposure rate, or vice versa.

Here $q_N(n)$ are certain functions of $n$ taking on nonnegative integer values when $n$ runs from 0 to $N$ and the dependence on $N$ is the main generalization here which requires certain conditions under which we obtain Poisson distributions limits of $\cN_N$ when counting is until $N$ as $N\to\infty$ and geometric distributions limits when counting is until $\tau_N$ as $N\to\infty$. ,mathematics

In this paper we succeeded to solve all necessary \emph{recurrence relations} to finalize full radial pullback of the main term of cubic self-interaction for higher spin gauge fields in Fronsdal's formulation from flat to one dimension less $AdS_{d+1}$ space. Nontrivial solutions of recurrence relations lead to the possibility to obtain the full set of $AdS_{d+1}$ dimensional interacting terms with all curvature corrections including trace and divergence terms from any interaction term in $d+2$ dimensional flat space.

"  Deformed sine-Gordon (DSG) models $\partial_\xi \partial_\eta \, w + \frac{d}{dw}V(w) = 0$, with $V(w)$ being the deformed potential, are considered in the context of the Riccati-type pseudopotential approach. A compatibility condition of the deformed system of Riccati-type equations reproduces the equation of motion of the DSG models. Then, we provide a pair of linear systems of equations for DSG model, and provide an infinite tower of non-local conservation laws. Through a direct construction and supported by numerical simulations of soliton scatterings, we show that the DSG models, which have recently been defined as quasi-integrable in the anomalous zero-curvature approach [Ferreira-Zakrzewski, JHEP05(2011)130], possess new towers of infinite number of quasi-conservation laws. We compute numerically the first sets of non-trivial and independent charges (beyond energy and momentum) of the DSG model: the two third order conserved charges and the two fifth order asymptotically conserved charges in the pseudopotential approach, and the first four anomalies of the new towers of charges, respectively. We consider kink-kink, kink-antikink and breather configurations for the Bazeia {\sl et al.} potential $V_{q}(w) = \frac{64}{q^2} \tan^2{\frac{w}{2}} (1-|\sin{\frac{w}{2}}|^q)^2 \, (q \in R)$, which contains the usual SG potential $V_2(w) = 2[1- \cos{(2 w)}]$.

"  Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are rapid neutron capture ($\textit{r}$-process) nucleosynthesis sites that expel matter at high velocities, from $0.1c$ to as high as $0.6c$. Nuclei ejected at these speeds are sufficiently energetic to initiate spallation nuclear reactions with interstellar medium particles. We adopt a thick-target model for the propagation of high-speed heavy nuclei in the interstellar medium, similar to the transport of cosmic rays. We find that spallation may create observable perturbations to NSM isotopic abundances, particularly around the low-mass edges of the $\textit{r}$-process peaks where neighboring nuclei have very different abundances. The extent to which spallation modifies the final NSM isotopic yields depends on: (1) the ejected abundances, which are determined by the NSM astrophysical conditions and the properties of nuclei far from stability, (2) the ejecta velocity distribution and propagation in interstellar matter, and (3) the spallation cross-sections. Observed solar and stellar $\textit{r}$-process yields could thus constrain the velocity distribution of ejected neutron star matter, assuming NSMs are the dominant $\textit{r}$-process source. We suggest avenues for future work, including measurement of relevant cross sections. ",astrophysics
"  Recently, in (Eur.Phys.J.C 80 (2020) 5, 432), the present authors obtained general stringent conditions on the localization of fields in braneworlds by imposing that its zero-mode must satisfy Einstein's equations (EE). Here, we continue this study by considering free $p$-form. These fields present an on-shell equivalency relation between a $p$-form and a $(D-p-2)$-form, provided by Hodge duality (HD). This symmetry will impose a new consistency condition, namely, confinement of a $p$-form must imply the localization of its dual. We apply the above conditions to $6$D braneworlds. With this, we find that in global string-like defects, for example, the $1$-form has a normalizable zero-mode. By using the HD, we show that its bulk dual $3$-form also has a normalizable zero-mode, making the confinement consistent with HD. However, these solutions cannot be made consistent with EE, therefore, these fields must be ruled out. In fact, by imposing both conditions, only the scalar and its dual field can be consistently localized. In this way, all the literature so far in which the free $1$-form is localized in codimension two models should be reviewed. These results also point to the fact that the symmetries of the fields can be used to verify the consistency of their localization and even prohibit it. ",high energy physics theory
"  Stars can be consumed (either tidally disrupted or swallowed whole) by massive black holes (MBHs) at galactic centers when they move into the vicinity of the MBHs. In this study, we investigate the rates of stellar consumption by central MBHs and their cosmic distributions, including the effects of triaxial galaxy shapes in enhancing the reservoir of low-angular-momentum stars and incorporating realistic galaxy distributions. We find that the enhancement in the stellar consumption rates due to triaxial galaxy shapes can be significant, by a factor of ~3 for MBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^6$Msun and up to more than one order of magnitude for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^8$Msun. Only for $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun are the stellar consumption rates significantly higher in galaxies with steeper inner surface brightness profiles. The average (per galaxy) stellar consumption rates correlate with central MBH masses positively for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^7$Msun and negatively for $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun. The volumetric stellar tidal disruption rates are ~$3\times10^{-5}$/yr/Mpc$^3$ for MBHs in the mass range of $10^5$-$10^8$Msun at z=0; and the volumetric stellar consumption rates by MBHs with higher masses are ~$10^{-6}$/yr/Mpc$^3$, which can be the stellar tidal disruption rate if the high-mass BHs are extremely spinning Kerr BHs or the rate of being swallowed if those BHs are Schwarzschild ones. The volumetric stellar consumption rates decrease with increasing redshift, and the decrease is relatively mild for $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^7$Msun and stronger for higher $M_{\rm BH}$. Most of the stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) at z=0 occur in galaxies with mass $M_{\rm gal}\lesssim10^{11}$Msun, and about 1%-2% of the TDEs can occur in high-mass galaxies with $M_{\rm gal}\gtrsim10^{11}$Msun.

"  In this work we aim at investigating the effects of baryons on the dark matter (DM) haloes structure, focusing on the correlation between the presence and importance of stellar discs and the halo shapes. We study the properties of a subsample of DM haloes from Fenix and EAGLE cosmological simulations. We inspect the central regions of haloes in the mass range [10.9 - 992.3] x 10^{10} Msun at z=0, comparing the hydrodynamic runs and their dark matter only (DMo) counterparts. Our results indicate that baryons have a significant impact on the shape of the inner halo, mainly within ~ 20 percent of the virial radius. We find haloes to be more spherical when hosting baryons. While the impact of baryons depends on the mass of the haloes, we also find a trend with morphology which suggests that the way baryons are assembled is also relevant in agreement with previous works. Our findings also indicate that disc galaxies preferentially form in haloes whose DMo counterparts were originally more spherical and with stronger velocity anisotropy. The presence of baryons alter the orbital structure of the DM particles of the haloes, which show a decrease in their velocity anisotropy, towards more tangentially biased orbits. This relative decrease is weaker in the case of disc-dominated galaxies. Our results point out to a cosmological connection between the final morphology of galaxies and the intrinsic properties of their DM haloes, which gets reinforce by the growth of the discs.

"  In [Cou15] a multiplier technique, going back to Leray and G{\aa}rding for scalar hyperbolic partial differential equations, has been extended to the context of finite difference schemes for evolutionary problems. The key point of the analysis in [Cou15] was to obtain a discrete energy-dissipation balance law when the initial difference operator is multiplied by a suitable quantity. The construction of the energy and dissipation functionals was achieved in [Cou15] under the assumption that all modes were separated. We relax this assumption here and construct, for the same multiplier as in [Cou15], the energy and dissipation functionals when some modes cross. Semigroup estimates for fully discrete hy-perbolic initial boundary value problems are deduced in this broader context by following the arguments of [Cou15]. ",mathematics

"  We consider the discrete shrinking target problem for Teichm\""uller geodesic flow on the moduli space of abelian or quadratic differentials and prove that the discrete geodesic trajectory of almost every differential will hit a shrinking family of targets infinitely often provided the measures of the targets are not summable. This result applies to any ergodic $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$--invariant measure and any nested family of spherical targets. Under stronger conditions on the targets, we moreover prove that almost every differential will eventually always hit the targets. As an application, we obtain a logarithm law describing the rate at which generic discrete trajectories accumulate on a given point in moduli space. These results build on work of Kelmer and generalize theorems of Aimino, Nicol, and Todd. ",mathematics
"  In this paper, we will analyze the short distance corrections to low energy scattering. They are produced because of an intrinsic extended structure of the background geometry of spacetime. It will be observed that the deformation produced by a minimal measurable length can have low energy consequences, if this extended structure occurs at a scale much larger than the Planck scale. We explicitly calculate short distance corrections to the Green function of the deformed Lippmann-Schwinger equation, and to the conserved currents for these processes. We then use them to analyze the pre-asymptotic corrections to the differential scattering flux at finite macroscopically small distances. ",high energy physics theory
"  We study the effects of rounding on the moments of a random variable. Specifically, given a random variable $X$ and its rounded counterpart $\operatorname{rd}(X)$, we study $|\mathbf{E}[X^k] - \mathbf{E}[\operatorname{rd}(X)^{k}]|$ for non-negative integer $k$. We consider the case that the rounding function $\operatorname{rd} : \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{F}$ corresponds either to (i) rounding to the nearest point in some discrete set $\mathbb{F}$ or (ii) rounding randomly to either the nearest larger or smaller point in this same set with probabilities proportional to the distances to these points. In both cases, we show, under reasonable assumptions on the density function of $X$, how to compute a constant $C$ such that $|\mathbb{E}[X^k] - \mathbb{E}[\operatorname{rd}(X)^{k}]| < C \epsilon^2$, provided $\operatorname{rd}(x) - x| \leq \epsilon E(x)$.

The distinct radiation signature of such plasmas is the $\gamma$-ray emission dominated by the prompt de-excitation nuclear lines and $\pi^0$-decay $\gamma$-rays. Using a large nuclear reaction network, we compute the time evolution of the chemical composition of such hot plasmas and their $\gamma$-ray line emissivity. At higher energies, we provide simple but accurate analytical presentations for the $\pi^0$-meson production rate and the corresponding $\pi^0\to2\gamma$ emissivity derived for the Maxwellian distribution of protons.

"  The requirement for continual improvement of idle speed control (ISC) performance is increasing due to the stringent regulation on emission and fuel economy these days. In this regard, a low-complexity offset-free explicit model predictive control (EMPC) with constraint horizon is designed to regulate the idle speed under unmeasured disturbance in presence of system delay with rigorous formulation. Particularly, we developed a high-fidelity 4-stroke gasoline-direct injected spark-ignited engine model based on first-principles and test vehicle driving data, and designed a model predictive ISC system. To handle the delay from intake to torque production, we constructed a control-oriented model with delay augmentation. To reject the influence of torque loss, we implemented the offset-free MPC scheme with disturbance model and estimator. Moreover, to deal with the limited capacity assigned for the controller in the engine control unit and the short sampling instant of the engine system, we formulated a low-complexity multiparametric quadratic program with constraint horizon in presence of system delay in state and input variables, and obtained an explicit solution map. To demonstrate the performance of the designed controller, a series of closed-loop simulations were performed. The developed explicit controller showed proper ISC performance in presence of torque loss and system delay. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  The dynamics of cellular chemical reactions are variable due to stochastic noise from intrinsic and extrinsic sources. The intrinsic noise is the intracellular fluctuations of molecular copy numbers caused by the probabilistic encounter of molecules and is modeled by the chemical master equation. The extrinsic noise, on the other hand, represents the intercellular variation of the kinetic parameters due to the variation of global factors affecting gene expression. The objective of this paper is to propose a computational framework to analyze the combined effect of the intrinsic and the extrinsic noise modeled by the chemical master equation with uncertain parameters. More specifically, we formulate a convex optimization problem to compute the intervals of the stationary solution of uncertain moment equations whose parameters are given only partially in the form of the statistics of their distributions. The optimization program is derived without approximating the governing equation in contrast with many existing approaches. Thus, we can obtain guaranteed intervals of the worst possible values of the moments for all parameter distributions satisfying the given statistics, which is useful for model-based rational engineering of biomolecular circuits in synthetic biology, where the robustness of synthetic reactions is important. We demonstrate the proposed optimization approach using two examples of stochastic chemical reactions and show that the solution of the optimization problem gives practically useful upper and lower bounds of the statistics of the stationary copy number distributions.

"  For nearly 40 years, dark matter has been widely assumed to be cold and collisionless. Cold dark matter models make fundamental predictions for the behavior of dark matter on small (<10 kpc) scales. These predictions include cuspy density profiles at the centers of dark matter halos and a halo mass function that increases as dN/dM ~ M^-1.9 down to very small masses. We suggest two observational programs relying on extremely large telescopes to critically test these predictions, and thus shed new light on the nature of dark matter. (1) Combining adaptive optics-enabled imaging with deep spectroscopy to measure the three-dimensional motions of stars within a sample of Local Group dwarf galaxies that are the cleanest dark matter laboratories known in the nearby universe. From these observations the inner slope of the dark matter density profile can be determined with an accuracy of 0.20 dex, enabling a central cusp to be distinguished from a core at 5 sigma significance. (2) Diffraction-limited AO imaging and integral field spectroscopy of gravitationally lensed galaxies and quasars to quantify the abundance of dark substructures in the halos of the lens galaxies and along the line of sight. Observations of 50 lensed arcs and 50 multiply-imaged quasars will be sufficient to measure the halo mass function over the range 10^7 < M < 10^10 Msun at cosmological scales, independent of the baryonic and stellar composition of those structures. These two observational probes provide complementary information about the small scale structure, with a joint self-consistent analysis mitigating limitations of either probe. This program will produce the strongest existing constraints on the properties of dark matter on small scales, allowing conclusive tests of alternative warm, fuzzy, and self-interacting dark matter models.

"  Intermolecular bonds are weak compared to covalent bonds, but they are strong enough to influence the properties of large molecular systems. In this work, we investigate how strong light-matter coupling inside an optical cavity can modify these intermolecular forces. We perform a detailed comparison between currently available ab initio electron-photon methodologies. The electromagnetic field inside the cavity can modulate the ground state properties of weakly bound complexes. Controlling the field polarization, the interactions can be stabilized or destabilized, and electron densities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities can be altered. We demonstrate that electron-photon correlation is fundamental to describe intermolecular interactions in strong light-matter coupling. This work proposes optical cavities as a novel tool to manipulate and control ground state properties, solvent effects, and intermolecular interactions for molecules and materials. ",physics
"  Aims. We aim to constrain the size and porosity of ejected dust particles from comet 252P/LINEAR and their evolution near the perihelion via near-infrared multiband polarimetry. A close approach of the comet to the Earth in March 2016 (~0.036 au) provided a rare opportunity for the sampling of the comet with a high spatial resolution. Methods. We made NIR JHKS bands polarimetric observations of the comet for 12 days near perihelion, interspersed between broadband optical imaging observations over four months. In addition, dynamical simulation of the comet was performed 1000 yr backward in time. Results. We detected two discontinuous brightness enhancements. Before the first enhancement, the NIR polarization degrees were far lower than those of ordinary comets at a given phase angle. Soon after the activation, however, they increased by ~13 % at most, showing unusual blue polarimetric color over the J and H bands (-2.55 % / um on average) and bluing of both J-H and H-Ks dust color. Throughout the event, the polarization vector was marginally aligned perpendicular to the scattering plane. The subsequent postperihelion reactivation of the comet lasted for approximately 1.5 months, with a factor of ~30 times pre-activation dust mass-loss rates in the Rc band. Conclusions. The marked increase in the polarization degree with blue NIR polarimetric color is reminiscent of the behaviors of a fragmenting comet D/1999 S4 (LINEAR). The most plausible scenario for the observed polarimetric properties of 252P/LINEAR would be an ejection of predominantly large, compact dust particles from the desiccated surface layer. We conjecture that the more intense solar heating that the comet has received in the near-Earth orbit would cause the paucity of small, fluffy dust particles around the nucleus of the comet.

"  In this note, we are interested on the event of extinction and the property of coming down from infinity of continuous state branching (or CB for short) processes with competition in a L\'evy environment whose branching mechanism satisfies the so-called Grey's condition. In particular, we deduce, under the assumption that the L\'evy environment does not drift towards infinity, that for any starting point the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s. Moreover if we impose an integrability condition on the competition mechanism, then the process comes down from infinity regardless the long term behaviour of the environment. ",mathematics

We propose a general primal-dual algorithmic framework that unifies many existing state-of-the-art algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method to the exact solution in the presence of the non-smooth term. Moreover, for the more general class of problems with agent specific non-smooth terms, we show that linear convergence cannot be achieved (in the worst case) for the class of algorithms that uses the gradients and the proximal mappings of the smooth and non-smooth parts, respectively. We further provide a numerical counterexample that shows how some state-of-the-art algorithms fail to converge linearly for strongly-convex objectives and different local non-smooth terms.

"  We propose a technique to develop (and localize in) topological maps from light detection and ranging (Lidar) data. Localizing an autonomous vehicle with respect to a reference map in real-time is crucial for its safe operation. Owing to the rich information provided by Lidar sensors, these are emerging as a promising choice for this task. However, since a Lidar outputs a large amount of data every fraction of a second, it is progressively harder to process the information in real-time. Consequently, current systems have migrated towards faster alternatives at the expense of accuracy. To overcome this inherent trade-off between latency and accuracy, we propose a technique to develop topological maps from Lidar data using the orthogonal Tucker3 tensor decomposition. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that in addition to achieving a high compression ratio as compared to full data, the proposed technique, $\textit{TensorMap}$, also accurately detects the position of the vehicle in a graph-based representation of a map. We also analyze the robustness of the proposed technique to Gaussian and translational noise, thus initiating explorations into potential applications of tensor decompositions in Lidar data analysis.

"  We present a general approach to model an integrated source of counterpropagating continuous-variable entangled states based on a coupled-resonator optical waveguide that is pumped by a classical pulsed source incident from above the waveguide. This paper is an extension of our previous work~(Ref. \cite{PhysRevA.100.033839}), where we analytically investigated the generation and propagation of continues-variable entangled states in this coupled-cavity system in the presence of intrinsic loss. However, in this work, we employ a numerical method to implement the Schmidt decomposition method rather than pursuing analytical methods. We show that not only this gives us a much higher degree of freedom in choosing the pumping parameters which were not possible to investigate analytically, but also it enables us to go beyond some of the approximations we had made to derive analytical expressions before.

"  Lithium niobate (LN), dubbed by many as the silicon of photonics, has recently risen to the forefront of chip-scale nonlinear optics research since its demonstration as an ultralow-loss integrated photonics platform. Due to its significant quadratic nonlinearity ($\chi^{(2)}$), LN inspires many important applications such as second-harmonic generation (SHG), spontaneous parametric down-conversion, and optical parametric oscillation. Here, we demonstrate high-efficiency SHG in dual-resonant, periodically poled z-cut LN microrings, where quasi-phase matching is realized by field-assisted domain engineering. Meanwhile, dual-band operation is accessed by optimizing the coupling conditions in fundamental and second-harmonic bands via a single pulley waveguide. As a result, when pumping a periodically poled LN microring in the low power regime at around 1617nm, an on-chip SHG efficiency of 250,000%/W is achieved, a state-of-the-art value reported among current integrated photonics platforms. An absolute conversion efficiency of 15% is recorded with a low pump power of 115$\mu$W in the waveguide. Such periodically poled LN microrings also present a versatile platform for other cavity-enhanced quasi-phase matched $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear optical processes. ",physics
"  We explore the possibility to systematically study the extended, hot gaseous halos of low-redshift galaxies with Coronal Broad Ly alpha Absorbers (CBLAs). These are weak, thermally broadenend HI absorption lines arising from the tiny fraction of neutral hydrogen that resides in the collisionally ionized, million-degree halo gas in these galaxies. Using a semi-analytic approach, we model the spatial density and temperature distribution of hot coronal gas to predict strength, spectral shape, and cross section of CBLAs as a function of galaxy-halo mass and line-of-sight impact parameter. For virial halo masses in the range log (M/M_sun)=10.6-12.6, the characteristic logarithmic CBLA HI column densities and Doppler parameters are log N(HI)=12.4-13.4 and b(HI)=70-200 km/s, indicating that CBLAs represent weak, shallow spectral features that are difficult to detect. Yet, the expected number density of CBLAs per unit redshift in the above given mass range is dN/dz(CBLA)~3, implying that CBLAs have a substantial absorption cross-section. We compare the model predictions with a combined set of ultraviolet (UV) absorption-line spectra from HST/COS and HST/STIS that trace the halos of four low-redshift galaxies. We demonstrate that CBLAs already might have been detected in these spectra, but the complex multi-component structure and the limited signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) complicate the interpretation of these CBLA candidate systems. Our study suggests that CBLAs represent a very interesting absorber class that potentially will allow us to further explore the hot coronae of galaxies with UV spectral data. ",astrophysics

"  A formulation of Covariant Canonical Quantization is discussed, which works on an extended Hilbert space and reduces to conventional canonical quantization when constraining to the solution of the field equation a priori. From the formal point of view it may be seen as a formalism between the canonical operator and the functional integral approach. A covariant number operator and two symmetric vacua are constructed. By that means, certain well-known quantities like the LSZ formula are rederived via a projection limit. The time-ordering operator can be replaced by taking into account the mirrored vacuum as well. Then the quantum field theoretical divergences like the vacuum energy arise a posteriori when a spacetime split is performed. The role of the vacuum energy in different contexts is then discussed in general. ",high energy physics theory

"  To improve the localization precision of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), a novel framework is established by jointly utilizing multiple measurements of received signal strength (RSS) from multiple base stations (BSs) and multiple points on trajectory. First, a joint maximum likelihood (ML) of exploiting both trajectory information and multi-BSs is proposed. To reduce its high complexity, two low-complexity localization methods are designed. The first method is from BS to trajectory (BST), called LCSL-BST. First, fixing the nth BS, by exploiting multiple measurements along trajectory, the position of UAV is computed by ML rule. Finally, all computed positions of UAV for different BSs are combined to form the resulting position. The second method reverses the order, called LCSL-TBS. We also derive the Cramer-Rao lower boundary (CRLB) of the joint ML method. From simulation results, we can see that the proposed joint ML and separate LCSL-BST methods have made a significant improvement over conventional ML method without use of trajectory knowledge in terms of location performance. The former achieves the joint CRLB and the latter is of low-complexity. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We refine the recently introduced notion of eclectic spin chains by including a maximal number of deformation parameters. These models are integrable, nearest-neighbor n-state spin chains with exceedingly simple non-hermitian Hamiltonians.

We show how and why the quantum inverse scattering method, sought to be universally applicable to integrable nearest-neighbor spin chains, essentially fails to reproduce the details of this spectrum. We then provide, for n=3, detailed evidence by a variety of analytical and numerical techniques that the spectrum is not ""random"", but instead shows surprisingly subtle and regular patterns that moreover exhibit universality for generic deformation parameters. We also introduce a new model, the hypereclectic spin chain, where all parameters are zero except for one. Despite the extreme simplicity of its Hamiltonian, it still seems to reproduce the above ""generic"" spectra as a subset of an even more intricate overall spectrum.

"  We study the critical properties of scalar field theories in $d+1$ dimensions with $O(N)$ invariant interactions localized on a $d$-dimensional boundary. By a combination of large $N$ and epsilon expansions, we provide evidence for the existence of non-trivial $O(N)$ BCFTs in $1<d<4$. Due to having free fields in the bulk, these models possess bulk higher-spin currents which are conserved up to terms localized on the boundary. We suggest that this should lead to a set of protected spinning operators on the boundary, and give evidence that their anomalous dimensions vanish. We also discuss the closely related long-range $O(N)$ models in $d$ dimensions, and in particular study a weakly coupled description of the $d=1$ long range $O(N)$ model near the upper critical value of the long range parameter, which is given in terms of a non-local non-linear sigma model.

"  In the traditional load flow analysis, a key assumption is that the input variables, i.e., generator output and customer demand, are fixed in time and the associated response has no variability. This assumption, however, is no longer valid as the adoption of renewable energy resources add more variability and uncertainty to the modern electrical system. Addressing these concerns is the definition of the Probabilistic Load Flow (PLF) problem. The challenge of the PLF problem lies in handling high-dimensional input uncertainties and the non-linearity of the load flow equations. The most straightforward way to address these problems, but at the cost of computational time, is to perform a Monte Carlo method. This work, however, solves these problems -- accuracy, high-dimensionality, and computational time -- with a coupled Karhunen-Lo\`eve (KL) expansion and Anisotropic Sparse Grid algorithm.

"  In the local universe, a large fraction of the baryon content is believed to exist as diffuse gas in filaments. While this gas is directly observable in X-ray emission around clusters of galaxies, it is primarily studied through its UV absorption. Recently, X-ray observations of large-scale filaments connecting to the cosmic web around the nearby ($z=0.05584$) cluster Abell 133 were reported. One of these filaments is intersected by the sightline to quasar [VV98] J010250.2$-$220929, allowing for a first-ever census of cold, cool, and warm gas in a filament of the cosmic web where hot gas has been seen in X-ray emission. Here, we present UV observations with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and optical observations with the Magellan Echellette spectrograph of [VV98] J010250.2$-$220929. We find no evidence of cold, cool, or warm gas associated with the filament. In particular, we set a $2\sigma$ upper limit on Ly$\alpha$ absorption of $\log(N_{HI} / \textrm{cm}^{-2}) < 13.7$, assuming a Doppler parameter of $b=20\,\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}$. As this sightline is ${\sim}1100\,\textrm{pkpc}$ ($0.7R_\textrm{vir}$) from the center of Abell 133, we suggest that all gas in the filament is hot at this location, or that any warm, cool, or cold components are small and clumpy. A broader census of this system -- combining more UV sightlines, deeper X-ray observations, and a larger redshift catalog of cluster members -- is needed to better understand the roles of filaments around clusters.

Sci. Reports 10.1 (2020) 1-8) with the help of the properties of the nonextensive entropy Sq of index q: a dominant oscillating mode arises as H goes to zero in many different systems and its amplitude is proportional to 1/ H^2 . Thus, a decrease of H acts as precursor of large oscillations of the state variable, which corresponds to catastrophic events in many problems of practical interest. In contrast, if H goes to 1 then the time series is strongly intermittent, fluctuations of the state variable follow a power law whose exponent depends on H, and exceedingly large event are basically unpredictable. These predictions agree with observations in problems of aeroacoustics, aeroelasticity, electric engineering, hydrology, laser physics, meteorology, plasma physics, plasticity, polemology, seismology and thermoacoustics.

"  This paper investigates the distributed consensus tracking control problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) with external disturbances and heterogeneous time-varying input and communication delays under a directed communication graph topology, containing a spanning tree. First, for all agents whose state matrix has no eigenvalues with positive real parts, a communication-delay-related observer, which is used to construct the controller, is designed for followers to estimate the leader's state information. Second, by means of the output regulation theory, the results are relaxed to the case that only the leader's state matrix eigenvalues have non-positive real parts and, under these relaxed conditions, the controller is redesigned. Both cases lead to a closed-loop error system of which the stability is guaranteed via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with sufficient conditions in terms of input-delay-dependent linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An extended LMI is proposed which, in conjunction with the rest of LMIs, results in a solution with a larger upper bound on delays than what would be feasible without it. It is highlighted that the integration of communication-delay-related observer and input-delay-related LMI to construct a fully distributed controller (which requires no global information) is scalable to arbitrarily large networks. The efficacy of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via illustrative numerical examples. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We developed a frequency-domain model describing optical frequency-comb generation in optical resonators with second- and third-order nonlinearities. Compared with time-domain models, our model in principle allows one to express the cavity dispersion accurately, avoiding the dispersion being truncated beyond a certain order. Moreover, the frequency-domain model can readily include frequency dependence of system parameters, such as the linear absorption and the cavity coupling ratio. To demonstrate the validity of our model, we numerically simulated quadratic combs in a singly resonant second-harmonic generation cavity and Kerr combs in a micro-resonator as two examples. The simulated results obtained from the frequency-domain model agree well with those given by previous time-domain models. A system containing both second- and third-order nonlinearities can give rise to many novel physical dynamics. The developed frequency-domain model will contribute to understanding optical frequency-comb generation assisted by multi-order nonlinear processes in various optical resonators. ",physics

It turns out that for every fixed point one can allocate either instanton or anti-instanton contributions to the partition function, and that this is compatible with supersymmetry. The equivariant Donaldson-Witten theory is a special case of our construction. We present a unified treatment of Pestun's calculation on $S^4$ and equivariant Donaldson-Witten theory by generalizing the notion of self-duality on manifolds with a vector field. We conjecture the full partition function for a ${\cal N}=2$ theory on any 4D manifold with a Killing vector. Using this new notion of self-duality to localize a supersymmetric theory is what we call ""Pestunization"". ",high energy physics theory
  We compute anomalous transport phenomena sourced by vector and axial magnetic fields in out of equilibrium setups produced by Vaidya background metrics in holography. We use generalized Vaidya metrics that include momentum relaxation induced by massless scalar fields. While the background metric and gauge field show formally instantaneous thermalization the chiral magnetic effect has significantly large equilibration times. We study how the equilibration of the chiral magnetic effect depends on the length of the Vaidya quench and the momentum relaxation parameter. These results shed some light on aspects of the chiral magnetic effect in out of equilibrium situations as the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions. ,high energy physics theory
"  We demonstrate an optical frequency analysis method using the Fourier transform of detection times of fluorescence photons emitted from a single trapped 40Ca+ ion. The response of the detected photon rate to the relative laser frequency deviations is recorded within the slope of a dark resonance formed in the lambda-type energy level scheme corresponding to two optical dipole transitions. This approach enhances the sensitivity to the small frequency deviations and does so with reciprocal dependence on the fluorescence rate. The employed lasers are phase locked to an optical frequency comb, which allows for precise calibration of optical frequency analysis by deterministic modulation of the analyzed laser beam with respect to the reference beam. The attainable high signal-to-noise ratios of up to a MHz range of modulation deviations and up to a hundred kHz modulation frequencies promise the applicability of the presented results in a broad range of optical spectroscopic applications.

"  Reconciling the geology of Mars with models of atmospheric evolution remains a major challenge. Martian geology is characterized by past evidence for episodic surface liquid water, and geochemistry indicating a slow and intermittent transition from wetter to drier and more oxidizing surface conditions. Here we present a new model incorporating randomized injection of reducing greenhouse gases and oxidation due to hydrogen escape, to investigate the conditions responsible for these diverse observations. We find that Mars could have transitioned repeatedly from reducing (H2-rich) to oxidizing (O2-rich) atmospheric conditions in its early history. Our model predicts a generally cold early Mars, with mean annual temperatures below 240 K. If peak reducing gas release rates and background CO2 levels are high enough, it nonetheless exhibits episodic warm intervals sufficient to degrade crater walls, form valley networks and create other fluvial/lacustrine features. Our model also predicts transient buildup of atmospheric O2, which can help explain the occurrence of oxidized mineral species such as manganese oxides at Gale Crater. We suggest that the apparent Noachian--Hesperian transition from phyllosilicate deposition to sulfate deposition around 3.5 billion years ago can be explained as a combined outcome of increasing planetary oxidation, decreasing groundwater availability and a waning bolide impactor flux, which dramatically slowed the remobilization and thermochemical destruction of surface sulfates. Ultimately, rapid and repeated variations in Mars' early climate and surface chemistry would have presented both challenges and opportunities for any emergent microbial life. ",astrophysics

Channel covariance information can be used for designing transmitter precoders, receiver combiners, channel estimators, etc. However, hybrid structures allow only a lower-dimensional signal to be observed, which adds difficulties for channel covariance matrix estimation. In this paper, we formulate the channel covariance estimation as a structured low-rank matrix sensing problem via Kronecker product expansion and use a low-complexity algorithm to solve this problem.

"  In this work, we have investigated anisotropic neutron stars in the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. All our calculations were computed using the IU-FSU realistic equation of state (EoS), in which was considered two cases: standard nucleonic composition and the one with the eight lightest baryons. From the neutron star masses and radii obtained we conclude that anisotropic pressure has significant consequences on the structure of stellar objects. In particular, when anisotropy is considered within the general relativity framework, it significantly modifies the maximum stellar mass. On the other hand, when Rastall-Rainbow gravity and anisotropy are simultaneously considered, they provide the best results for mass and radius values, including important astrophysical objects such as the LMXB NGC 6397 and the extremely massive pulsar millisecond MSP J0740 + 6620. Although the expected inclusion of hyperons in the nuclear model reproduces stellar masses smaller than those produced by standard nucleonic matter, we shown that the hyperon puzzle problem can be solved by including anisotropic effects on compact stars in the context of the Rastall-Rainbow gravity.

"  We suggest a new action for a ``dual'' gravity in a stringy $R$, $Q$ flux background. The construction is based on degree-$2$ graded symplectic geometry with a homological vector field. The structure we consider is non-canonical and features a curvature-free connection. It is known that the data of Poisson structures of degree $2$ with a Hamiltonian correspond to a Courant algebroid on $TM \oplus T^{*}M$, the bundle of generalized geometry. With the bracket for the Courant algebroid and a further bracket which resembles the Lie bracket of vector fields, we get a connection with non-zero curvature for the bundle of generalized geometry. The action is the (almost) Hilbert-Einstein action for that connection. ",high energy physics theory
"  This thesis is devoted to the study of dynamical symmetry enhancement of black hole horizons in string theory. In particular, we consider supersymmetric horizons in the low energy limit of string theory known as supergravity and we prove the $\textit{horizon conjecture}$ for a number of supergravity theories. We first give important examples of symmetry enhancement in $D=4$ and the mathematical preliminaries required for the analysis. Type IIA supergravity is the low energy limit of $D=10$ IIA string theory, but also the dimensional reduction of $D=11$ supergravity which itself the low energy limit of M-theory. We prove that Killing horizons in IIA supergravity with compact spatial sections preserve an even number of supersymmetries. By analyzing the global properties of the Killing spinors, we prove that the near-horizon geometries undergo a supersymmetry enhancement. This follows from a set of generalized Lichnerowicz-type theorems we establish, together with an index theory argument. We also show that the symmetry algebra of horizons with non-trivial fluxes includes an $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ subalgebra. As an intermediate step in the proof, we also demonstrate new Lichnerowicz type theorems for spin bundle connections whose holonomy is contained in a general linear group. We prove the same result for Roman's Massive IIA supergravity. We also consider the near-horizon geometry of supersymmetric extremal black holes in un-gauged and gauged 5-dimensional supergravity, coupled to abelian vector multiplets. We consider important examples in $D=5$ such as the BMPV and supersymmetric black ring solution, and investigate the near-horizon geometry to show the enhancement of the symmetry algebra of the Killing vectors. We repeat a similar analysis as above to prove the horizon conjecture. We also investigate the conditions on the geometry of the spatial horizon section $\cal{S}$. ",high energy physics theory
"  We study wireless power transmission by an energy source to multiple energy harvesting nodes with the aim to maximize the energy efficiency. The source transmits energy to the nodes using one of the available power levels in each time slot and the nodes transmit information back to the energy source using the harvested energy. The source does not have any channel state information and it only knows whether a received codeword from a given node was successfully decoded or not. With this limited information, the source has to learn the optimal power level that maximizes the energy efficiency of the network. We model the problem as a stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits problem and develop an Upper Confidence Bound based algorithm, which learns the optimal transmit power of the energy source that maximizes the energy efficiency. Numerical results validate the performance guarantees of the proposed algorithm and show significant gains compared to the benchmark schemes. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Context. The solar chromosphere and the lower transition region is believed to play a crucial role in the heating of the solar corona. Models that describe the chromosphere (and the lower transition region), accounting for its highly dynamic and structured character are, so far, found to be lacking. This is partly due to the breakdown of complete frequency redistribution in the chromospheric layers and also because of the difficulty in obtaining complete sets of observations that adequately constrain the solar atmosphere at all relevant heights. Aims. We aim to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres that reproduce the features of the Mg II h&k line profiles that sample the middle chromosphere with focus on a sunspot. Methods. We use spectropolarimetric observations of the Ca II 8542 A spectra obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and use NICOLE inversions to obtain semi-empirical model atmospheres for different features in and around a sunspot. These are used to synthesize Mg II h&k spectra using RH1.5D code, which we compare with observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Results. Comparison of the synthetic profiles with IRIS observations reveals that there are several areas, especially in the penumbra of the sunspot, where most of the observed Mg II h&k profiles are very well reproduced. In addition, we find that supersonic hot downflows, present in our collection of models in the umbra, lead to synthetic profiles that agree well with the IRIS Mg II h&k profiles, with the exception of the line core. Conclusions. We put forward and make available four semi-empirical model atmospheres. Two for the penumbra, reflecting the range of temperatures obtained for the chromosphere, one for umbral flashes, and a model representative of the quiet surroundings of a sunspot. These are available in electronic as well as in table formats. ",astrophysics

The inequality gives a simple form of the upper bound, and it has been utilized for many investigations. However, the inequality is not tight.

Each subsequent generation of the population successively loses the most disadvantageous strategies of behavior of the previous generation.

The concept of strategy complexity is introduced. It is shown that strategies that win in natural selection have maximum or near maximum complexity.

The winning strategies always belonged to the so-called respectable strategies that are clearly prone to cooperation. ",physics
"  We present the results of experimental studies on the transverse and longitudinal dynamics of a single electron in the IOTA storage ring. IOTA is a flexible machine dedicated to beam physics experiments with electrons and protons. A method was developed to reliably inject and circulate a controlled number of electrons in the ring. A key beam diagnostic system is the set of sensitive high-resolution digital cameras for the detection of synchrotron light emitted by the electrons. With 60--130 electrons in the machine, we measured beam lifetime and derived an absolute calibration of the optical system. At exposure times of 0.5~s, the cameras were sensitive to individual electrons. Camera images were used to reconstruct the time evolution of oscillation amplitudes of a single electron in all 3~degrees of freedom. The evolution of amplitudes directly showed the interplay between synchrotron-radiation damping, quantum excitations, and scattering with the residual gas. From the distribution of measured single-electron oscillation amplitudes, we deduced transverse emittances, momentum spread, damping times, and beam energy. Estimates of residual-gas density and composition were calculated from the measured distributions of vertical scattering angles. Combining scattering and lifetime data, we also provide an estimate of the aperture of the ring. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the dynamics of a single electron is tracked in all three dimensions with digital cameras in a storage ring. ",physics

"  Strong eastward jets at the equator have been observed in many planetary atmospheres and simulated in numerical models of varying complexity. However, the nature of the transition from a conventional state of the general circulation, with easterlies or weak westerlies in the tropics, to such a superrotating state remains unclear. Is it abrupt or continuous? This question may have far-reaching consequences, as it may provide a mechanism for abrupt climate change in a planetary atmosphere, both through the loss of stability of the conventional circulation and through potential noise-induced transitions in the bistability range. We study two feedbacks which may lead to bistability between a conventional and a superrotating state: the Hadley cell feedback and a wave-jet resonance feedback. We delineate the regime of applicability of these two mechanisms in a simple model of zonal acceleration budget at the equator. Then, we show using numerical simulations of the axisymmetric primitive equations that the wave-jet resonance feedback indeed leads to robust bistability, while the bistability governed by the Hadley cell feedback, although observed in our numerical simulations, is much more fragile in a multilevel model.

"  A coupled dielectric-metal metasurface (CDMM) consisting of amorphous silicon (a-$\textit{Si}$) rings and subwavelength holes in $\textit{Au}$ layer separated by a $\textit{SiO}_{2}$ layer is presented.

The filter also has a 100 nm quite zone with $\sim 10^{-2}$ transmittance. A radiating two-oscillator model reveals the fundamental resonances in the filter which interfere to produce the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) like effect.

The presented CDMM filter is robust to artifacts in device fabrication and has performances comparable to a conventional Fabry-P\'{e}rot filter. However, it is easier to be integrated in image sensors as the transmittance peak can be tuned by only changing the periodicity resulting in a planar structure with a fixed height. ",physics

Our findings clarify the role of the semi-classical object in resurgence structure, which has been a controversial issue in recent years. ",high energy physics theory
"  We present a comprehensive analysis of electronic recoil vs. nuclear recoil discrimination in liquid/gas xenon time projection chambers, using calibration data from the 2013 and 2014-16 runs of the Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment. We observe strong charge-to-light discrimination enhancement with increased event energy. For events with S1 = 120 detected photons, i.e. equivalent to a nuclear recoil energy of $\sim$100 keV, we observe an electronic recoil background acceptance of $<10^{-5}$ at a nuclear recoil signal acceptance of 50%. We also observe modest electric field dependence of the discrimination power, which peaks at a field of around 300 V/cm over the range of fields explored in this study (50-500 V/cm). In the WIMP search region of S1 = 1-80 phd, the minimum electronic recoil leakage we observe is ${(7.3\pm0.6)\times10^{-4}}$, which is obtained for a drift field of 240-290 V/cm. Pulse shape discrimination is utilized to improve our results, and we find that, at low energies and low fields, there is an additional reduction in background leakage by a factor of up to 3. We develop an empirical model for recombination fluctuations which, when used alongside the Noble Element Scintillation Technique (NEST) simulation package, correctly reproduces the skewness of the electronic recoil data. We use this updated simulation to study the width of the electronic recoil band, finding that its dominant contribution comes from electron-ion recombination fluctuations, followed in magnitude of contribution by fluctuations in the S1 signal, fluctuations in the S2 signal, and fluctuations in the total number of quanta produced for a given energy deposition.

"  Photonic gauge potentials are crucial for manipulating charge-neutral photons like their counterpart electrons in the electromagnetic field, allowing analogous Aharonov-Bohm effect in photonics and paving the way for critical applications like photonic isolation. Normally, a gauge potential exhibits phase inversion along two opposite propagation paths. Here we experimentally demonstrate phonon-induced anomalous gauge potentials with non-inverted gauge phases in a spatial-frequency space, where quasi-phase-matched nonlinear Brillouin scatterings enable such unique direction-dependent gauge phases. Based on this scheme, we construct photonic isolators in the frequency domain permitting nonreciprocal propagation of light along the frequency axis, where coherent phase control in the photonic isolator allows switching completely the directionality through an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Moreover, similar coherent controlled unidirectional frequency conversions are also illustrated.

"  It is well known that cohomology of any non-trivial 1-dimensional local system on a nilmanifold vanishes (this result is due to L. Alaniya). A complex nilmanifold is a quotient of a nilpotent Lie group equipped with a left-invariant complex structure by an action of a discrete, co-compact subgroup. We prove a Dolbeault version of Alaniya's theorem, showing that the Dolbeault cohomology of a nilpotent Lie algebra with coefficients in any non-trivial 1-dimensional local system vanishes. Note that the Dolbeault cohomology of the corresponding local system on the manifold is not necessarily zero. This implies that the twisted version of Console-Fino theorem is false (Console-Fino proved that the Dolbeault cohomology of a complex nilmanifold is equal to the Dolbeault cohomology of its Lie algebra). As an application, we give a new proof of a theorem due to H. Sawai, who obtained an explicit description of LCK nilmanifolds. An LCK structure on a manifold $M$ is a K\""ahler structure on its cover $\tilde M$ such that the deck transform map acts on $\tilde M$ by homotheties.

In nuclear families, children build families of their own after marriage, whereas in extended families, children stay at the parents' home. The inheritance of wealth among siblings is whether equal or unequal. These two dichotomies shape the four basic family systems. However, their origin remains unknown. In this study, we theoretically simulated a model of preindustrial peasant societies consisting of families. By introducing family-level and society-level competition for their growth, we demonstrated that the four family systems emerge depending on environmental conditions characterizing the land scarcity and the external perturbations that damage society. The commencement of agriculture and the area location explain the geographical distribution of family systems across the world. Analyses on the wealth distribution among families demonstrate the connection between family systems and socio-economic structures quantitatively.

"  We develop a formalism for photoionization (PI) and potential energy curves (PECs) of Rydberg atoms in ponderomotive optical lattices and apply it to examples covering several regimes of the optical-lattice depth. The effect of lattice-induced PI on Rydberg-atom lifetime ranges from noticeable to highly dominant when compared with natural decay. The PI behavior is governed by the generally rapid decrease of the PI cross sections as a function of angular-momentum ($\ell$), and by lattice-induced $\ell$-mixing across the optical-lattice PECs. In GHz-deep lattices, $\ell$-mixing leads to a rich PEC structure, and the significant low-$\ell$ PI cross sections are distributed over many lattice-mixed Rydberg states. In lattices less than several tens-of-MHz deep, atoms on low-$\ell$ PECs are essentially $\ell$-mixing-free and maintain large PI cross sections, while atoms on high-$\ell$ PECs trend towards being PI-free. Characterization of PI in GHz-deep Rydberg-atom lattices may be beneficial for optical control and quantum-state manipulation of Rydberg atoms, while data on PI in shallower lattices are potentially useful in high-precision spectroscopy and quantum-computing applications of lattice-confined Rydberg atoms.

"  Decision making needs to take an uncertain environment into account. Over the last decades, robust optimization has emerged as a preeminent method to produce solutions that are immunized against uncertainty. The main focus in robust discrete optimization has been on the analysis and solution of one- or two-stage problems, where the decision maker has limited options in reacting to additional knowledge gained after parts of the solution have been fixed. Due to its computational difficulty, multistage problems beyond two stages have received less attention.   In this paper we argue that multistage robust discrete problems can be seen through the lens of quantified integer programs, where powerful tools to reduce the search tree size have been developed. By formulating both integer and quantified integer programming formulations, it is possible to compare the performance of state-of-the-art solvers from both worlds. Using selection, assignment, lot-sizing and knapsack problems as a testbed, we show that problems with up to nine stages can be solved to optimality in reasonable time. ",mathematics
"  Most terrestrial sand seas form at `horse' latitudes, where the wind direction exhibits seasonal variation. Here, we extend the two-dimensional linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed associated with a unidirectional wind to the three-dimensional case in order to account for multidirectional wind regimes. Focusing on the simplest case of bidirectional flow regimes, we show that the transition from transverse to oblique or longitudinal patterns is controlled by the transport ratio and the divergence angle between the two flows. Our predictions agree with previous results for dune orientation, and also provide a wider range of possible alignments depending on flow strength, especially when the two winds are perpendicular, at which the transition occurs. This analysis also predicts the selected pattern wavelength, which either decreases close to the transition angle for strong winds, due to a geometric effect, or increases at low winds, when the bed slope affects the transport. This theoretical analysis is complemented by analogous subaqueous experiments, where bedforms are submitted to alternate water flows. For transverse bedforms, the experimental data validate the model at strong flows, providing evidence for the predicted geometric effect, but also for the increase of the wavelength close to the transport threshold. For longitudinal bedforms, a discrepancy is observed, which we interpret as the sign of enhanced nonlinearities induced by the development of slip faces when the flow alternately blows on both sides of the dune.
