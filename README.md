## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging the power of **LLMs** for **classification** tasks.
It explores both traditional classification approaches and the fine-tuning of pre-trained models 
to achieve high accuracy and performance on a custom dataset. The main goal is to demonstrate how LLMs can 
be adapted for specific domain-related classification problems.

## Features
- **Classification**: Scripts for performing classification using various machine learning and deep learning models.

- **Fine-tuning**: Code to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs (e.g., from the Hugging Face library) on a custom dataset.
