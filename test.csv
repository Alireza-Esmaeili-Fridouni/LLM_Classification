"  Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) measurements generally provide phase images which represent the signature of domain structures on the surface of nanomaterials. To quantitatively determine magnetic stray fields based on an MFM image requires calibrated properties of the magnetic tip. In this work, an approach is presented for calibrating a magnetic tip using a Co/Pt multilayered film as a reference sample which shows stable well-known magnetic properties and well-defined perpendicular band domains. The approach is based on a regularized deconvolution process in Fourier domain with a Wiener filter and the L-curve method for determining a suitable regularization parameter to get a physically reasonable result. The calibrated tip is applied for a traceable quantitative determination of the stray fields of a test sample which has a patial frequency spectrum covered by that of the reference sample. According to the ""Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement"", uncertainties of the processing algorithm are estimated considering the fact that the regularization influences significantly the quantitative analysis. We discuss relevant uncertainty components and their propagations between real domain and Fourier domain for both, the tip calibration procedure and the stray field calculation, and propose an uncertainty evaluation procedure for quantitative magnetic force microscopy.

  Audio-to-score alignment aims at generating an accurate mapping between a performance audio and the score of a given piece. Standard alignment methods are based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and employ handcrafted features. We explore the usage of neural networks as a preprocessing step for DTW-based automatic alignment methods. Experiments on music data from different acoustic conditions demonstrate that this method generates robust alignments whilst being adaptable at the same time. ,electrical engineering and systems science
"  In 1986, while at UCLA working with C. Fronsdal and M. Flato, I proposed a model for conformal QED that I claimed to be divergence-free and nontrivial. The results for one loop calculation were given. However, a debate about unitarity and nontriviality of the model caused the withholding of publication of that work. Now and more than 30 years, students and colleagues suggested that with recent results there is a merit to the publication of the original study so that the problem could be revisited, independently investigated and the calculations be repeated. Consequently, I present here the work exactly as it appeared then in a UCLA preprint of the Theoretical Elementary Particle physics group with preprint number UCLA/86/TEP/31.

"  Shock reflection experiments are performed to study the large-scale convective mixing created by the forward jetting phenomenon. Experiments are performed at a wedge angle of $\theta_{\mathrm{w}} = 30^{\circ}$ in nitrogen, propane-oxygen, and hexane with incident shock Mach numbers up to $M = 4$. Experiments are complimented by shock-resolved viscous simulations of triple point reflection in hexane for $M = 2.5$ to $6$. Inviscid simulations are performed over a wider range of parameters. Reynolds numbers up to $Re \lesssim 10^3$ are covered by simulations and Reynolds numbers of $Re \sim 10^5$ are covered by experiments. The study shows that as the isentropic exponent is lowered, and as the Mach number and Reynolds number are increased, the forward jet approaches the Mach stem, forms a vortex, deforms the shock front and in some cases bifurcates the Mach stem. Experiments show Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the vortex cause large-scale convective mixing behind the Mach stem at low isentropic exponents ($\gamma \le 1.15$). The limits of Mach stem bifurcation (triple Mach-White reflection) in inviscid simulations are plotted in the phase space of $M$- $\theta_{\mathrm{w}}$-$\gamma$. A maximum isentropic exponent of $\gamma \approx 1.3$ is found beyond which bifurcation does not occur (at $\theta_{\mathrm{w}} = 30^{\circ}$). This closely matches the boundary between irregular/regular detonation cellular structures. ",physics
"  We investigate recursive relations for the Grothendieck classes of the affine graph hypersurface complements of melonic graphs. We compute these classes explicitly for several families of melonic graphs, focusing on the case of graphs with valence-$4$ internal vertices, relevant to CTKT tensor models. The results hint at a complex and interesting structure, in terms of divisibility relations or nontrivial relations between classes of graphs in different families. Using the recursive relations we prove that the Grothendieck classes of all melonic graphs are positive as polynomials in the class of the moduli space $\mathcal M_{0,4}$. We also conjecture that the corresponding polynomials are log-concave, on the basis of hundreds of explicit computations. ",mathematics
"  We explain some interesting relations in the degree three bounded cohomology of surface groups. Specifically, we show that if two faithful Kleinian surface group representations are quasi-isometric, then their bounded fundamental classes are the same in bounded cohomology. This is novel in the setting that one end is degenerate, while the other end is geometrically finite. We also show that a difference of two singly degenerate classes with bounded geometry is boundedly cohomologous to a doubly degenerate class, which has a nice geometric interpretation. Finally, we explain that the above relations completely describe the linear dependences between the `geometric' bounded classes defined by the volume cocycle with bounded geometry. We obtain a mapping class group invariant Banach sub-space of the reduced degree three bounded cohomology with explicit topological generating set and describe all linear relations. ",mathematics
"  In this paper, we present a deep learning-based (DL-based) algorithm, as a purely mathematical platform, for providing intuitive understanding of the properties of electromagnetic (EM) wave-matter interaction in nanostructures. This approach is based on using the dimensionality reduction (DR) technique to significantly reduce the dimensionality of a generic EM wave-matter interaction problem without imposing significant error. Such an approach implicitly provides useful information about the role of different features (or design parameters such as geometry) of the nanostructure in its response functionality. To demonstrate the practical capabilities of this DL-based technique, we apply it to a reconfigurable optical metadevice enabling dual-band and triple-band optical absorption in the telecommunication window. Combination of the proposed approach with existing commercialized full-wave simulation tools offers a powerful toolkit to extract basic mechanisms of wave-matter interaction in complex EM devices and facilitate the design and optimization of nanostructures for a large range of applications including imaging, spectroscopy, and signal processing. It is worth to mention that the demonstrated approach is general and can be used in a large range of problems as long as enough training data can be provided. ",physics

"  We discuss the time dependence of subsystem entropies in interacting quantum systems. As a model for the time dependence, we suggest that the entropy is as large as possible given two constraints: one follows from the existence of an emergent light cone, and the other is a conjecture associated to the ""entanglement velocity"" $v_E$. We compare this model to new holographic and spin chain computations, and to an operator growth picture. Finally, we introduce a second way of computing the emergent light cone speed in holographic theories that provides a boundary dynamics explanation for a special case of entanglement wedge subregion duality in AdS/CFT.

"  We construct a traversable wormhole from a charged AdS black hole by adding a coupling between the two boundary theories. We investigate how the effect of this deformation behaves in the extremal limit of the black hole. The black holes have finite entropy but an infinitely long throat in the extremal limit. We argue that it is still possible to make the throat traversable even in the extremal limit, but this requires either tuning the field for which we add a boundary coupling close to an instability threshold or scaling the strength of the coupling inversely with the temperature. In the latter case we show that the amount of information that can be sent through the wormhole scales with the entropy. ",high energy physics theory
"  Given discrete time observations over a growing time interval, we consider a nonparametric Bayesian approach to estimation of the L\'evy density of a L\'evy process belonging to a flexible class of infinite activity subordinators. Posterior inference is performed via MCMC, and we circumvent the problem of the intractable likelihood via the data augmentation device, that in our case relies on bridge process sampling via Gamma process bridges. Our approach also requires the use of a new infinite-dimensional form of a reversible jump MCMC algorithm. We show that our method leads to good practical results in challenging simulation examples. On the theoretical side, we establish that our nonparametric Bayesian procedure is consistent: in the low frequency data setting, with equispaced in time observations and intervals between successive observations remaining fixed, the posterior asymptotically, as the sample size $n\rightarrow\infty$, concentrates around the L\'evy density under which the data have been generated. Finally, we test our method on a classical insurance dataset. ",mathematics

"  Recent studies on direct imaging of Type II core-collapse supernova progenitors indicate a possible threshold around $M_{\rm ZAMS}\sim 16-20$ M$_\odot$, where red supergiants with larger birth masses do not appear to result in supernova explosions and instead implode directly into a black hole. In this study we argue that it is not a coincidence that this threshold closely matches the critical transition of central Carbon burning in massive stars from the convective to radiative regime. In lighter stars, Carbon burns convectively in the center and result in compact final presupernova cores that are likely to result in explosions, while in heavier stars after the transition, it burns as a radiative flame and the stellar cores become significantly harder to explode. Using the KEPLER code we demonstrate the sensitivity of this transition to the rate of $^{12}$C$(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}$O reaction and the overshoot mixing efficiency, and we argue that the upper mass limit of exploding red supergiants could be employed to constrain uncertain input physics of massive stellar evolution calculations. The initial mass corresponding to the central Carbon burning transition range from 14 to 26 M$_\odot$ in recently published models from various groups and codes, and only a few are in agreement with the estimates inferred from direct imaging studies.

"  Free space optical communication has been applied in many scenarios because of its security, low cost and high rates. In such scenarios, a tracking system is necessary to ensure an acceptable signal power. Free space optical links were considered unable to support optical mobile communication when nodes are randomly moving at a high speed because existing tracking schemes fail to track the nodes accurately and rapidly. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking system exploiting multiple beacon laser sources. At the receiver, each beacon laser's power is measured to estimate the orientation of the target. Unlike existing schemes which drive servo motors multiple times based on consecutive measurements and feedback, our scheme can directly estimate the next optimal targeting shift for the servo motors based on a single measurement, allowing the tracking system to converge much faster. Closed-form outage probability expression is derived for the optical mobile communication system with ideal tracking, where pointing error and moving statistics are considered. To maintain sufficient average power and reduce the outage probability, the recommended size of a source spot is expressed in closed form as a function of the target's statistics of random moving, providing insights to the system design.

In our approach, the contributions to the 't Hooft anomalies due to boundary conditions at the punctures are determined entirely by $G_4$-flux in the 11d geometry. This computation provides a top-down derivation of these contributions that utilizes the geometric definition of the field theories, complementing the previous field-theoretic arguments.

"  Spin ensembles coupled to optical cavities provide a powerful platform for engineering synthetic quantum matter. Recently, we demonstrated that cavity mediated infinite range interactions can induce fast scrambling in a Heisenberg $XXZ$ spin chain (Phys. Rev. Research {\bf 2}, 043399 (2020)). In this work, we analyze the kaleidoscope of quantum phases that emerge in this system from the interplay of these interactions. Employing both analytical spin-wave theory as well as numerical DMRG calculations, we find that there is a large parameter regime where the continuous $U(1)$ symmetry of this model is spontaneously broken and the ground state of the system exhibits $XY$ order. This kind of symmetry breaking and the consequent long range order is forbidden for short range interacting systems by the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Intriguingly, we find that the $XY$ order can be induced by even an infinitesimally weak infinite range interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in the $U(1)$ symmetry broken phase, the half chain entanglement entropy violates the area law logarithmically. Finally, we discuss a proposal to verify our predictions in state-of-the-art quantum emulators. ",quantum physics
"  The Hawking temperature for Schwarzschild black hole $T_H=1/8\pi M$ is singular in the limit of vanishing mass $M\to 0$. However, the Schwarzschild metric itself is regular in this limit, it is reduced to the Minkowski metric and there are no reasons to believe that the temperature becomes infinite. This discrepancy may be due to the singularity of the Kruskal coordinates in this limit.   To improve the situation, new coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric are introduced, called thermal coordinates, which depend on the black hole mass $ M $ and the parameter $b$. The thermal coordinates are regular in the limit $M\to 0$ when the Schwarzschild metric reduces to Minkowski metric, written in coordinates dual to the Rindler coordinates. Using the thermal coordinates the Schwarzschild black hole radiation is reconsidered and it is found that the Hawking formula for temperature is valid only for large black holes while for small black holes the temperature is $T=1/2\pi(4M+b)$. The thermal observer in Minkowski space sees radiation with temperature $T=1/2\pi b$, similar to the Unruh effect with non-constant acceleration.   During evaporation, in the thermal coordinates the black hole mass is decreasing inverse proportional to time and the black hole lifetime is infinite. More general spherically symmetric metrics are considered and it is found that the property to have a temperature is not restricted to the cases of black holes or constant acceleration, but is valid for any spherically symmetric metric written in thermal coordinates. Implications for primordial black holes and for the information loss problem are mentioned. ",high energy physics theory

"  In this paper, a numerical study is conducted to investigate boiling of a cryogen on a solid surface as well as on a liquid surface. Both single mode and multi-mode boiling is reported for boiling on to a solid surface. In case of boiling on a liquid surface, liquid nitrogen is selected as the cryogen (boiling fluid) and water is chosen as the base fluid (heating fluid). Different flow instabilities and their underlying consequences during boiling of a cryogen are also discussed. For the boiling on a solid surface, in the single mode, bubble growth, its departure, and area weighted average heat flux are reported, where they increase linearly with increase in the wall superheat. Asymmetry in the bubble growth and departure of 2nd batch of the vapor bubbles have been observed due to local fluctuations and turbulence created just after the pinch off of the 1st batch of vapor bubbles in case of multi-mode boiling on the solid surface. Boiling of LN2 on a liquid surface is reported for a base fluid (Water) temperature of 300 K. Vapor film thickness decreases with time and the minimum film thickness just before rupture is 7.62 micrometer, dominance of thermocapillary over vapor thrust causes breaking of the vapor film at 0.0325s.

We propose that certain holographic heat engines can be considered models of quantum heat engines, and the possible fruitfulness of this connection is discussed. Motivated by features of quantum heat engines that take a quantum system through analogues of certain classic thermodynamic cycles, some black hole Otto and Diesel cycles are presented and explored for the first time. In the expected regime of overlap, our Otto efficiency formulae are of the form exhibited by quantum and classical heat engines. ",high energy physics theory
"  A fundamental difference between a neutron star (NS) and a black hole (BH) is the absence of a physical surface in the latter. For this reason, any remaining kinetic energy of the matter accreting onto a BH is advected inside its event horizon. In the case of an NS, on the contrary, accreting material is decelerated on the NS surface, and its kinetic energy is eventually radiated away. Copious soft photons produced by the NS surface will affect the properties of the Comptonised component dominating spectra of X-ray binaries in the hard state. Thus, parameters of the Comptonised spectra -- the electron temperature $kT_{\rm e}$ and the Compton $y$-parameter, could serve as an important tool for distinguishing BHs from NSs. In this paper, we systematically analyse heretofore the largest sample of spectra from the BH and NS X-ray binaries in the hard state for this purpose, using archival RXTE/PCA and RXTE/HEXTE observations. We find that the BHs and NSs occupy distinctly different regions in the $y-kT_{\rm e}$ plane with NSs being characterised by systematically lower values of $y$-parameter and electron temperature. Due to the shape of the boundary between BHs and NSs on the $y-kT_{\rm e}$ plane, their one-dimensional $y$ and $kT_{\rm e}$ distributions have some overlap. A cleaner one parameter diagnostic of the nature of the compact object in X-ray binaries is provided by the Compton amplification factor $A$, with the boundary between BHs and NSs lying at $A\approx 3.5-4$. This is by far the most significant detection of the imprint of the event horizon on the X-ray spectra for stable stellar-mass BHs. ",astrophysics

More specifically, we study the dynamics of a single particle on an oblate squashed Haldane sphere i.e. a 2-sphere enclosing a single magnetic monopole at its center. While several features of the conventional Haldane sphere persist, by numerically solving the Schrodinger equation in this background, we find that the particle becomes increasingly localised in a band between the equator and the poles, with a corresponding increase of the eccentricity of the spheroid.

"  Coordinating the operations of separate wireless systems at the wavelength level can lead to significant improvements in wireless capabilities. We address a fundamental challenge in distributed radio frequency system cooperation - inter-node phase alignment - which must be accomplished wirelessly, and is particularly challenging when the nodes are in relative motion.

Using this approach, we present the design of the first fully wireless distributed system operating at the wavelength level. We demonstrate the system in the first open-loop coherent distributed beamforming experiment. Internode range estimation to support phase alignment was performed using a two-tone stepped frequency waveform with a single pulse, while a two-tone waveform was used for frequency synchronization, where the oscillator of a secondary node was disciplined to the primary node. In this concept, secondary nodes are equipped with an adjunct self-mixing circuit that is able to extract the reference frequency from the captured synchronization waveform. The approach was implemented on a two-node dynamic system using Ettus X310 software-defined radios, with coherent beamforming at 1.5 GHz. We demonstrate distributed beamforming with greater than 90% of the maximum possible coherent gain throughout the displacement of the secondary node over one full cycle of the beamforming frequency.

This provides a thorough understanding of mirror symmetry as well as the $R$-symmetries that appear as a consequence of the automorphy factors of modular transformations. It leads to a complete picture of local flavor unification in the $(T,U)$ modulus landscape. In view of applications towards the flavor structure of particle physics models, we are led to top-down constructions with high predictive power. The first reason is the very limited availability of flavor representations of twisted matter fields as well as their (fixed) modular weights. This is followed by severe restrictions from traditional and (finite) modular flavor symmetries, mirror symmetry, CP and $R$-symmetries on the superpotential and Kaehler potential of the theory.

"  We consider on one hand the possibility that a supersymmetric ${\cal N}=1$ conformal gauge theory has a strongly coupled locus on the conformal manifold at which a different, dual, conformal gauge theory becomes a good weakly coupled description. On the other hand we discuss the possibility that strongly coupled theories, e.g. SCFTs in class ${\cal S}$, having exactly marginal ${\cal N}=1$ deformations admit a weakly coupled gauge theory description on some locus of the conformal manifold. We present a simple algorithm to search for such dualities and discuss several concrete examples. In particular we find conformal duals for ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD models with $G_2$ gauge group and a model with $SU(4)$ gauge group in terms of simple quiver gauge theories.

The pairs of dual Lagrangians at the weakly coupled loci have different symmetries which are broken on a general point of the conformal manifold. We match the dimensions of the conformal manifolds, symmetries on the generic locus of the conformal manifold, anomalies, and supersymmetric indices.

The proposed approach merges two intermediate results: The first one relies on the characterization of an attractor around the origin, to which converges the closed-loop trajectories. The second result assesses the regional asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point by estimating its basin of attraction.

The pseudo-forest has a single tree connected to a constant partition function, many pseudo-trees connected to self-dual systems and all other pseudo-trees connected to closed cycles of transformations between mutually dual systems.

"  Fluctuations of thermodynamic observables, such as heat and work, contain relevant information on the underlying physical process. These fluctuations are however not taken into account in the traditional laws of thermodynamics. While the second law is extended to fluctuating systems by the celebrated fluctuation theorems, the first law is generally believed to hold even in the presence of fluctuations. Here we show that in the presence of quantum fluctuations, also the first law of thermodynamics may break down. This happens because quantum mechanics imposes constraints on the knowledge of heat and work. To illustrate our results, we provide a detailed case-study of work and heat fluctuations in a quantum heat engine based on a circuit QED architecture. We find probabilistic violations of the first law and show that they are closely connected to quantum signatures related to negative quasi-probabilities. Our results imply that in the presence of quantum fluctuations, the first law of thermodynamics may not be applicable to individual experimental runs. ",quantum physics

"  The aim of this work is to improve the modelling of ion populations in higher density, lower temperature astrophysical plasmas, of the type commonly found in lower solar and stellar atmospheres. Ion population models for these regions frequently employ the coronal approximation, which assumes conditions more suitable to the upper solar atmosphere, where high temperatures and lower densities prevail. Using the coronal approximation for modelling the solar transition region gives theoretical lines intensities for the Li-like and Na-like isoelectronic sequences which can be factors of 2-5 times lower than observed. The works of Burgess & Summers (1969) and Nussbaumer & Storey (1975) showed the important part ions in excited levels play when included in the modelling. Their models, however, used approximations for the atomic rates to determine the ion balance. Presented here is the first stage in updating these earlier models of carbon by using rates from up-to-date atomic calculations and more recent photo-ionising radiances for the quiet Sun. Where such atomic rates are not readily available, in the case of electron-impact direct ionisation and excitation--auto-ionisation, new calculations have been made and compared to theoretical and experimental studies. The effects each atomic process has on the ion populations as density changes is demonstrated, and final results from the modelling are compared to the earlier works. Lastly, the new results for ion populations are used to predict line intensities for the solar transition region in the quiet Sun, and these are compared with predictions from coronal-approximation modelling and with observations. Significant improvements in the predicted line intensities are seen in comparison to those obtained from zero-density modelling of carbon. ",astrophysics

The XUV power scaling and generation efficiency are similar to that achieved with a single Gaussian-mode fundamental beam inside a collinear enhancement cavity. The noncollinear geometry also opens the door for the generation of isolated attosecond pulses at >100 MHz repetition rate. ",physics

A simplified way of constructing the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional operators, fractional integral and fractional derivative, is presented along with examples of its application on different functions. Furthermore, an introduction to the Aitken's method is made and it is explained why it has the ability to accelerate the convergence of the iterative methods, to finally present the results that were obtained when implementing the Aitken's method in the F N-R method.

"  We describe the ongoing `Survey for Magnetars, Intermittent pulsars, Rotating radio transients and Fast radio bursts' (SMIRF), performed using the newly refurbished UTMOST telescope. SMIRF repeatedly sweeps the southern Galactic plane performing real-time periodicity and single-pulse searches, and is the first survey of its kind carried out with an interferometer. SMIRF is facilitated by a robotic scheduler which is capable of fully autonomous commensal operations. We report on the SMIRF observational parameters, the data analysis methods, the survey's sensitivities to pulsars, techniques to mitigate radio frequency interference and present some early survey results. UTMOST's wide field of view permits a full sweep of the Galactic plane to be performed every fortnight, two orders of magnitude faster than previous surveys. In the six months of operations from January to June 2018, we have performed $\sim 10$ sweeps of the Galactic plane with SMIRF. Notable blind re-detections include the magnetar PSR J1622$-$4950, the RRAT PSR J0941$-$3942 and the eclipsing pulsar PSR J1748$-$2446A. We also report the discovery of a new pulsar, PSR J1705$-$54. Our follow-up of this pulsar with the UTMOST and Parkes telescopes at an average flux limit of $\leq 20$ mJy and $\leq 0.16$ mJy respectively, categorizes this as an intermittent pulsar with a high nulling fraction of $< 0.002$ ",astrophysics
"  In this paper, we consider a dual-hop Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) wireless relay network in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI), in which a source-destination pair both equipped with multiple antennas communicates through a large number of half-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) relay terminals. We investigate the performance of three linear beamforming schemes when the CSI of relay-to-destination (R-D) link is not perfect at the relay nodes. The three efficient linear beamforming schemes are based on the matched-filter (MF), zero-forcing (ZF) precoding and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding techniques, which utilize the CSI of both S-D channel and R-D channel at the relay nodes. By modeling the R-D CSI error at the relay nodes as independent complex Gaussian random variables, we derive the ergodic capacities of the three beamformers in terms of instantaneous SNR. Using Law of Large Number, we obtain the asymptotic capacities, upon which the optimized MF-RZF is derived. Simulation results show that the asymptotic capacities match with the respective ergodic capacities very well. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the optimized MF-RZF outperforms MF and MF-ZF for any power of R-D CSI error. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  It is known that local, Lorentz invariant, unitary theories involving particles with spin 1 demand that the matter sector they couple to are organized by internal physical symmetries and the associated charge conservation, while spin 3/2 demands supersymmetry. However, the introduction of a spin 2 graviton does not obviously demand new symmetries of the matter sector (although it does demand a universal coupling). In this work we relax the assumption of Lorentz boost symmetry, while maintaining a basic notion of locality that there is no instantaneous signaling at a distance. This extends and complements our accompanying work in Part 1 on related issues for spin 1 particles in electromagnetism. In order to avoid potential problems with longitudinal modes of the graviton, we choose to project them out, leaving only two degrees of freedom. We study large classes of theories that a priori may violate Lorentz boost invariance. By requiring the tree-level exchange action be local, we find that consistency demands that the Lorentz boost symmetry must be satisfied by the graviton and the matter sector, and in turn we recover general relativity at this order of analysis.

The nodes of the denominator of the Pad\'{e} approximant give rise to poles in the charge complex plane. These poles move with the projectile velocity following a certain pattern. We find the positions of the poles of the Continuum Distorted Wave theory and an ensamble of experimental results. It was found that the ionization cross section may have oscillations in terms of the incident charge for a given impact velocity. ,physics

"  Channel estimation is one of the main tasks in realizing practical intelligent reflecting surface-assisted multi-user communication (IRS-MC) systems. However, different from traditional communication systems, an IRS-MC system generally involves a cascaded channel with a sophisticated statistical distribution. In this case, the optimal minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator requires the calculation of a multidimensional integration which is intractable to be implemented in practice. To further improve the channel estimation performance, in this paper, we model the channel estimation as a denoising problem and adopt a deep residual learning (DReL) approach to implicitly learn the residual noise for recovering the channel coefficients from the noisy pilot-based observations. To this end, we first develop a versatile DReL-based channel estimation framework where a deep residual network (DRN)-based MMSE estimator is derived in terms of Bayesian philosophy. As a realization of the developed DReL framework, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DRN (CDRN) is then proposed for channel estimation in IRS-MC systems, in which a CNN denoising block equipped with an element-wise subtraction structure is specifically designed to exploit both the spatial features of the noisy channel matrices and the additive nature of the noise simultaneously. In particular, an explicit expression of the proposed CDRN is derived and analyzed in terms of Bayesian estimation to characterize its properties theoretically. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of the optimal MMSE estimator requiring the availability of the prior probability density function of channel.

"  In this paper we study the adjacency spectrum of families of finite rooted trees with regular branching properties. In particular, we show that in the case of constant branching, the eigenvalues are realized as the roots of a family of generalized Fibonacci polynomials and produce a limiting distribution for the eigenvalues as the tree depth goes to infinity. We indicate how these results can be extended to periodic branching patterns and also provide a generalization to higher order simplicial complexes. ",mathematics
"  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are brief flashes of gamma rays, considered to be the most energetic explosive phenomena in the Universe. The emission from GRBs comprises a short (typically tens of seconds) and bright prompt emission, followed by a much longer afterglow phase. During the afterglow phase, the shocked outflow -- produced by the interaction between the ejected matter and the circumburst medium -- slows down, and a gradual decrease in brightness is observed. GRBs typically emit most of their energy via gamma-rays with energies in the kiloelectronvolt-to-megaelectronvolt range, but a few photons with energies of tens of gigaelectronvolts have been detected by space-based instruments. However, the origins of such high-energy (above one gigaelectronvolt) photons and the presence of very-high-energy (more than 100 gigaelectronvolts) emission have remained elussive. Here we report observations of very-high-energy emission in the bright GRB 180720B deep in the GRB afterglow -ten hours after the end of the prompt emission phase, when the X-ray flux had already decayed by four orders of magnitude. Two possible explanations exist for the observed radiation: inverse Compton emission and synchrotron emission of ultrarelativistic electrons. Our observations show that the energy fluxes in the X-ray and gamma-ray range and their photon indices remain comparable to each other throughout the afterglow. This discovery places distinct constraints on the GRB environment for both emission mechanisms, with the inverse Compton explanation alleviating the particle energy requirements for the emission observed at late times. The late timing of this detection has consequences for the future observations of GRBs at the highest energies. ",astrophysics

This paper initiates the study of the geometry of $\mathcal{H}$. We show that $\mathcal{H}$ is an infinite dimensional Riemannian manifold with non-positive sectional curvature. In the hypercritical phase case we show that $\mathcal{H}$ has a well-defined metric structure, and that its completion is a ${\rm CAT}(0)$ geodesic metric space, and hence has an intrinsically defined ideal boundary. Finally, we show that in the hypercritical phase case $\mathcal{H}$ admits $C^{1,1}$ geodesics, improving a result of the second author and Yau. Using results of Darvas-Lempert we show that this result is sharp. ",mathematics
"  In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), X-ray radiography is a critical diagnostic for measuring implosion dynamics, which contains rich 3D information. Traditional methods for reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D radiographs, such as filtered backprojection, require radiographs from at least two different angles or lines of sight (LOS). In ICF experiments, space for diagnostics is limited and cameras that can operate on the fast timescales are expensive to implement, limiting the number of projections that can be acquired. To improve the imaging quality as a result of this limitation, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to be capable of producing 3D models from visible light images or medical X-ray images rendered by volumetric computed tomography LOS (SLOS). We propose a CNN to reconstruct 3D ICF spherical shells from single radiographs. We also examine sensitivity of the 3D reconstruction to different illumination models using preprocessing techniques such as pseudo-flat fielding. To resolve the issue of the lack of 3D supervision, we show that training the CNN utilizing synthetic radiographs produced by known simulation methods allows for reconstruction of experimental data as long as the experimental data is similar to the synthetic data. We also show that the CNN allows for 3D reconstruction of shells that possess low mode asymmetries. Further comparisons of the 3D reconstructions with direct multiple LOS measurements are justified.

"  One of the key challenges in the battle against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is to detect and quantify the severity of the disease in a timely manner. Computed tomographies (CT) of the lungs are effective for assessing the state of the infection. Unfortunately, labeling CT scans can take a lot of time and effort, with up to 150 minutes per scan. We address this challenge introducing a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system that accelerates the labeling of CT scan images. Conventionally, active learning methods require the labelers to annotate whole images with full supervision, but that can lead to wasted efforts as many of the annotations could be redundant. Thus, our system presents the annotator with unlabeled regions that promise high information content and low annotation cost. Further, the system allows annotators to label regions using point-level supervision, which is much cheaper to acquire than per-pixel annotations. Our experiments on open-source COVID-19 datasets show that using an entropy-based method to rank unlabeled regions yields to significantly better results than random labeling of these regions. Also, we show that labeling small regions of images is more efficient than labeling whole images. Finally, we show that with only 7\% of the labeling effort required to label the whole training set gives us around 90\% of the performance obtained by training the model on the fully annotated training set.

"  An important application of Lebesgue integral quadrature arXiv:1807.06007 is developed. Given two random processes, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, two generalized eigenvalue problems can be formulated and solved. In addition to obtaining two Lebesgue quadratures (for $f$ and $g$) from two eigenproblems, the projections of $f$- and $g$- eigenvectors on each other allow to build a joint distribution estimator, the most general form of which is a density-matrix correlation. Examples of the density-matrix correlation can be a value-correlation $V_{f^{[i]};g^{[j]}}$, similar to a regular correlation concept, and a new one, a probability-correlation $P_{f^{[i]};g^{[j]}}$. If Christoffel function average is used instead of regular average the approach can be extended to an estimation of joint probability of three and more random processes. The theory is implemented numerically; the software is available under the GPLv3 license. ",mathematics

We restrict our attention to the case where $d^{\mu}$ is a time-like background vector, namely $d^{2}=d^{\mu}d_{\mu}>0$, and we verify that the classical self-energy is finite for any odd spatial dimension $n$ and diverges for even $n$. We also make some comments regarding obstacles in the quantization of the proposed model. ",high energy physics theory
"  Recent neural speech synthesis systems have gradually focused on the control of prosody to improve the quality of synthesized speech, but they rarely consider the variability of prosody and the correlation between prosody and semantics together. In this paper, a prosody learning mechanism is proposed to model the prosody of speech based on TTS system, where the prosody information of speech is extracted from the melspectrum by a prosody learner and combined with the phoneme sequence to reconstruct the mel-spectrum. Meanwhile, the sematic features of text from the pre-trained language model is introduced to improve the prosody prediction results. In addition, a novel self-attention structure, named as local attention, is proposed to lift this restriction of input text length, where the relative position information of the sequence is modeled by the relative position matrices so that the position encodings is no longer needed. Experiments on English and Mandarin show that speech with more satisfactory prosody has obtained in our model. Especially in Mandarin synthesis, our proposed model outperforms baseline model with a MOS gap of 0.08, and the overall naturalness of the synthesized speech has been significantly improved.

"  We present a spectral study of the ultraluminous Be/X-ray transient pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations during the system's 2017--2018 giant outburst. The 1.2--10~keV energy spectrum of the source can be approximated with an absorbed cut-off power law model. We detect strong, luminosity-dependent emission lines in the 6--7 keV energy range. A narrow 6.42 keV line, observed in the sub-Eddington regime, is seen to evolve into a broad Fe-line profile in the super-Eddington regime. Other features are found at 6.67 and 6.97 keV in the Fe-line complex. An asymmetric broad line profile, peaking at 6.67 keV, is possibly due to Doppler effects and gravitational redshift. The 1.2--79 keV broadband spectrum from NuSTAR and NICER observations at the outburst peak is well described by an absorbed cut-off power law plus multiple Gaussian lines and a blackbody component. Physical reflection models are also tested to probe the broad iron line feature. Depending on the mass accretion rate, we found emission sites that are evolving from ~5000 km to a range closer to the surface of the neutron star. Our findings are discussed in the framework of the accretion disk and its implication on the magnetic field, the presence of optically thick accretion curtain in the magnetosphere, jet emission, and the massive, ultra-fast outflow expected at super-Eddington accretion rates. We do not detect any signatures of a cyclotron absorption line in the NICER or NuSTAR data. ",astrophysics

With them, we demonstrate that pulse shaping allows modifying in a controlled way not only the spatio-temporal distribution of the light irradiance in the focal region, but also the way it propagates as well as the frequency distribution within the pulse (temporal chirp). To gain a further intuitive insight, the role of diverse added spectral phase components is analyzed, showing the symmetries that arise for each case.

"  4U 1543-47 is a low mass X-ray binary which harbours a stellar-mass black hole located in our Milky Way galaxy. In this paper, we revisit 7 data sets which were in the Steep Power Law state of the 2002 outburst. The spectra were observed by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We have carefully modelled the X-ray reflection spectra, and made a joint-fit to these spectra with relxill, for the reflected emission. We found a moderate black hole spin, which is $0.67_{-0.08}^{+0.15}$ at 90% statistical confidence. Negative and low spins (< 0.5) at more than 99% statistical confidence are ruled out. In addition, our results indicate that the model requires a super-solar iron abundance: $5.05_{-0.26}^{+1.21}$, and the inclination angle of the inner disc is $36.3_{-3.4}^{+5.3}$ degrees. This inclination angle is appreciably larger than the binary orbital inclination angle (~21 degrees); this difference is possibly a systematic artefact of the artificially low-density employed in the reflection model for this X-ray binary system.

"  Many biological systems can be described by finite Markov models. A general method for simplifying master equations is presented that is based on merging adjacent states. The approach preserves the steady-state probability distribution and all steady-state fluxes except the one between the merged states. Different levels of coarse graining of the underlying microscopic dynamics can be obtained by iteration, with the result being independent of the order in which states are merged. A criterion for the optimal level of coarse graining or resolution of the process is proposed via a tradeoff between the simplicity of the coarse-grained model and the information loss relative to the original model. As a case study, the method is applied to the cycle kinetics of the molecular motor kinesin. ",physics
"  Upon application of a sufficiently strong electric field, electrons break away from thermal equilibrium and approach relativistic speeds. These highly energetic runaway electrons (MeV) play a significant role in tokamak disruption physics, and therefore their accurate understanding is essential to develop reliable mitigation strategies. For this purpose, we have developed a fully implicit solver for the 0D-2P (i.e., including two momenta coordinates) relativistic nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation (rFP). As in earlier implicit rFP studies (NORSE, CQL3D), electron-ion interactions are modeled using the Lorentz operator, and synchrotron damping using the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac reaction term. However, our implementation improves on these earlier studies by 1) ensuring exact conservation properties for electron collisions, 2) strictly preserving positivity, and 3) being scalable algorithmically and in parallel. Key to our proposed approach is an efficient multigrid preconditioner for the linearized rFP equation, a multigrid elliptic solver for the Braams-Karney potentials [Braams and Karney, Phys. Rev. Lett. 59, 16 (1987)], and a novel adaptive technique to determine the associated boundary values.

"  We consider the baby-Skyrme model in the regime close to the so-called restricted baby-Skyrme model, which is a BPS model with area-preserving diffeomorphism invariance. The perturbation takes the form of the standard kinetic Dirichlet term with a small coefficient $\epsilon$. Classical solutions of this model, to leading order in $\epsilon$, are called restricted harmonic maps. In the BPS limit ($\epsilon\to 0$) of the model with the potential being the standard pion-mass term, the solution with unit topological charge is a compacton. Using analytical and numerical arguments we obtain solutions to the problem for topological sectors greater than one. We develop a perturbative scheme in $\epsilon$ with which we can calculate the corrections to the BPS mass. The leading order ($\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^1)$) corrections show that the baby Skyrmion with topological charge two is energetically preferred. The binding energy requires us to go to the third order in $\epsilon$ to capture the relevant terms in perturbation theory, however, the binding energy contributes to the total energy at order $\epsilon^2$. We find that the baby Skyrmions - in the near-BPS regime - are compactons of topological charge two, that touch each other on their periphery at a single point and with orientations in the attractive channel.

"  In this letter we consider two different models of our present universe. We choose the models which are consisting different sets of two seperate fluids. The first one of each set tries to justify the late time acceleration and the second one is barotropic fluid. The former model considers our present time universe to be homogeneously filled up by Generalized Chaplygin Gas which is interacting with barotropic fluid. On the other hand, the latter model considers that the cosmic acceleration is generated by Modified Chaplygin Gas which is interacting with matter depicted by barotropic equation of state. For both the models, we consider the interaction term to vary proportionally with Hubble's parameter as well as with the exotic matter/dark energy's energy density. We find an explicit function form of the energy density of the cosmos which is found to depend on different cosmological parameters like scale factor, dark energy and barotropic fluid's EoS parameters and other constants like interacting constants etc. We draw curves of effective EoS-s, different cosmological parameters like deceleration parameter $q$, statefinder parameters $r$ and $s$ with repect to the redshift $z$ (for different values of dark energy and barotopic fluid parameters) and study them thoroughly. We compare two models as well as the nature of dependencies on these models' interaction coefficients.

"  Medical image segmentation is routinely performed to isolate regions of interest, such as organs and lesions. Currently, deep learning is the state of the art for automatic segmentation, but is usually limited by the need for supervised training with large datasets that have been manually segmented by trained clinicians. The goal of semi-superised and unsupervised image segmentation is to greatly reduce, or even eliminate, the need for training data and therefore to minimze the burden on clinicians when training segmentation models. To this end we introduce a novel network architecture for capable of unsupervised and semi-supervised image segmentation called TricycleGAN. This approach uses three generative models to learn translations between medical images and segmentation maps using edge maps as an intermediate step. Distinct from other approaches based on generative networks, TricycleGAN relies on shape priors rather than colour and texture priors. As such, it is particularly well-suited for several domains of medical imaging, such as ultrasound imaging, where commonly used visual cues may be absent. We present experiments with TricycleGAN on a clinical dataset of kidney ultrasound images and the benchmark ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset. ",electrical engineering and systems science

"  The origin of thermal optical and UV emission from stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs) remains an open question. We present Hubble Space Telescope far-UV (FUV) observations of eight optical/UV selected TDFs 5-10 years post-peak. Six sources are cleanly detected, showing point-like FUV emission from the centers of their host galaxies. We discover that the light curves of TDFs from low-mass black holes ($<10^{6.5} M_\odot$) show significant late-time flattening. Conversely, FUV light curves from high-mass black hole TDFs are generally consistent with an extrapolation from the early-time light curve. The observed late-time emission cannot be explained by existing models for early-time TDF light curves (i.e. reprocessing or circularization shocks), but is instead consistent with a viscously spreading, unobscured accretion disk. These disk models can only reproduce the observed FUV luminosities, however, if they are assumed to be thermally and viscously stable, in contrast to the simplest predictions of alpha-disk theory. For one TDF in our sample, we measure an upper limit to the UV luminosity that is significantly lower than expectations from theoretical modeling and an extrapolation of the early-time light curve. This dearth of late-time emission could be due to a disk instability/state change absent in the rest of the sample. The disk models that explain the late-time UV detections solve the TDF ""missing energy problem"" by radiating a rest-mass energy of ~0.1 solar mass over a period of decades, primarily in extreme UV wavelengths.

Another observational signal of this era is the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which will be observed by the upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 experiments. The 21 cm signal and the contribution to the kSZ from the EoR are expected to be anti-correlated, the former coming from regions of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium and the latter coming from ionized regions. However, the naive cross-correlation between the kSZ and 21 cm maps suffers from a cancellation that occurs because ionized regions are equally likely to be moving toward or away from the observer and so there is no net correlation with the 21 cm signal. We present here an investigation of the 21 cm-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum, which should not suffer the same cancellation as the simple two-point cross-correlation. We show that there is a significant and non-vanishing signal that is sensitive to the reionization history, suggesting the statistic may be used to confirm or infer the ionization fraction as a function of redshift. In the absence of foreground contamination, we forecast that this signal is detectable at high statistical significance with HERA and SO. The bispectrum we study suffers from the fact that the kSZ signal is sensitive only to Fourier modes with long-wavelength line-of-sight components, which are generally lost in the 21 cm data sets owing to foreground contamination. We discuss possible strategies for alleviating this contamination, including an alternative four-point statistic that may help circumvent this issue. ",astrophysics
"  In the early 1930s, the positron, pair production, and, at last, positron annihilation were discovered. Over the years, several scientists have been credited with the discovery of the annihilation radiation. Commonly, Thibaud and Joliot have received credit for the discovery of positron annihilation. A conversation between Werner Heisenberg and Theodor Heiting prompted me to examine relevant publications, when these were submitted and published, and how experimental results were interpreted in the relevant articles. I argue that it was Theodor Heiting - usually not mentioned at all in relevant publications - who discovered positron annihilation, and that he should receive proper credit. ",physics
  We consider a nematic liquid crystal occupying the three-dimensional domain in the exterior of a spherical colloid particle. The nematic is subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions that enforce orthogonal attachment of nematic molecules to the surface of the particle. Our main interest is to understand the behavior of energy-critical configurations of the Landau-de Gennes $Q$-tensor model in the limit of vanishing correlation length. We demonstrate existence of configurations with a single Saturn-ring defect approaching the equator of the particle and no other line or point defects. We show this by analyzing asymptotics of energy minimizers under two symmetry constraints: rotational equivariance around the vertical axis and reflection across the horizontal plane. Energy blow-up at the ring defect is a significant obstacle to constructing well-behaved comparison maps needed to eliminate the possibility of point defects. The boundary estimates we develop to address this issue are new and should be applicable to a wider class of problems. ,mathematics
"  Quantization is essential to simplify DNN inference in edge applications. Existing uniform and non-uniform quantization methods, however, exhibit an inherent conflict between the representing range and representing resolution, and thereby result in either underutilized bit-width or significant accuracy drop. Moreover, these methods encounter three drawbacks: i) the absence of a quantitative metric for in-depth analysis of the source of the quantization errors; ii) the limited focus on the image classification tasks based on CNNs; iii) the unawareness of the real hardware and energy consumption reduced by lowering the bit-width. In this paper, we first define two quantitative metrics, i.e., the Clipping Error and rounding error, to analyze the quantization error distribution. We observe that the boundary- and rounding- errors vary significantly across layers, models and tasks. Consequently, we propose a novel quantization method to quantize the weight and activation. The key idea is to Approximate the Uniform quantization by Adaptively Superposing multiple Non-uniform quantized values, namely AUSN. AUSN is consist of a decoder-free coding scheme that efficiently exploits the bit-width to its extreme, a superposition quantization algorithm that can adapt the coding scheme to different DNN layers, models and tasks without extra hardware design effort, and a rounding scheme that can eliminate the well-known bit-width overflow and re-quantization issues. Theoretical analysis~(see Appendix A) and accuracy evaluation on various DNN models of different tasks show the effectiveness and generalization of AUSN. The synthesis~(see Appendix B) results on FPGA show $2\times$ reduction of the energy consumption, and $2\times$ to $4\times$ reduction of the hardware resource.

"  We demonstrate a flexible sensor for ascorbic acid detection in sweat based on single-step modified gold microelectrodes. The modification consists on the electrodeposition of alginate membrane with trapped CuO nanoparticles on top of the electrodes. The electrodes are fabricated at a thin polyimide support and the soft nature of the membrane can withstand mechanical stress far beyond the requirements for skin monitoring. We further show the efficient detection of ascorbic acid at the micromolar levels in both, a neutral buffer and acidic artificial sweat, at ultra-low applied potential (-5 mV). The effect of possible interfering species present in sweat is minimized, with no observable cross-reaction, thus maintaining a high degree of selectivity despite absence of enzymes in the fabrication scheme. This sensor is envisioned as a promising component of a wearable device for e.g. non-invasive monitoring of micronutrient loss through sweat. ",physics
"  In this paper we focus on dynamical properties of (real) convex projective surfaces. Our main theorem provides an asymptotic formula for the number of free homotopy classes with roughly the same renormalized Hilbert length for two distinct convex real projective structures. The correlation number in this asymptotic formula is characterized in terms of their Manhattan curve. We show that the correlation number is not uniformly bounded away from zero on the space of pairs of hyperbolic surfaces, answering a question of Schwartz and Sharp. In contrast, we provide examples of diverging sequences, defined via cubic rays, along which the correlation number stays larger than a uniform strictly positive constant. In the last section, we extend the correlation theorem to Hitchin representations. ",mathematics

In particular, each such graph with n vertices has an independent set of size at least 3n/11. ",mathematics
"  The pursuit of higher compression efficiency continuously drives the advances of video coding technologies. Fundamentally, we wish to find better ""predictions"" or ""priors"" that are reconstructed previously to remove the signal dependency efficiently and to accurately model the signal distribution for entropy coding. In this work, we propose a neural video compression framework, leveraging the spatial and temporal priors, independently and jointly to exploit the correlations in intra texture, optical flow based temporal motion and residuals. Spatial priors are generated using downscaled low-resolution features, while temporal priors (from previous reference frames and residuals) are captured using a convolutional neural network based long-short term memory (ConvLSTM) structure in a temporal recurrent fashion. All of these parts are connected and trained jointly towards the optimal rate-distortion performance. Compared with the High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Main Profile (MP), our method has demonstrated averaged 38% Bjontegaard-Delta Rate (BD-Rate) improvement using standard common test sequences, where the distortion is multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).

"  The theory of finitely supported algebraic structures is related to Pitts theory of nominal sets (by equipping finitely supported sets with finitely supported internal algebraic laws). It represents a reformulation of Zermelo Fraenkel set theory obtained by requiring every set theoretical construction to be finitely supported according to a certain action of a group of permutations of some basic elements named atoms. Its main purpose is to let us characterize infinite algebraic structures, defined involving atoms, only by analyzing their finite supports. The first goal of this paper is to define and study different kinds of infinities and the notion of `cardinality' in the framework of finitely supported structures. We present several properties of infinite cardinalities. Some of these properties are extended from the non-atomic Zermelo Fraenkel set theory into the world of atomic objects with finite support, while other properties are specific to finitely supported structures. We also compare alternative definitions of `infinite finitely supported set', and we finally provide a characterization of finitely supported countable sets. ",mathematics
"  Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most important research directions in the domain of digital data management. In this paper, a new feature extraction schema including the norm of low frequency components in wavelet transformation and color features in RGB and HSV domains are proposed as representative feature vector for images in database followed by appropriate similarity measure for each feature type. In CBIR systems, retrieving results are so sensitive to image features. We address this problem with selection of most relevant features among complete feature set by ant colony optimization (ACO)-based feature selection which minimize the number of features as well as maximize F-measure in CBIR system. To evaluate the performance of our proposed CBIR system, it has been compared with three older proposed systems. Results show that the precision and recall of our proposed system are higher than older ones for the majority of image categories in Corel database. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Motivated by recent experimental study on coherent dynamics transfer in three interacting atoms or electron spins \cite{Barredo:2015,Rosenfeld:2018}, here we study entanglement entropy transfer in three interacting qubits. We analytically calculate time evolutions of wave function, density matrix and entanglement of the system. We find that initially entangled two qubits may alternatively transfer their entanglement entropy to other two qubit pairs. So that dynamical evolution of three interacting qubits may produce a genuine three-partite entangled state through entanglement entropy transfers. In particular, different pairwise interactions of the three qubits endow symmetric and asymmetric evolutions of the entanglement transfer, characterized by the quantum mutual information and concurence. Finally, we discuss an experimental proposal of three Rydberg atoms for testing the entanglement dynamics transfer of this kind. ",quantum physics
"  We propose that a simple, Lagrangian 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0, 2)$ duality interface between the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ XYZ model and 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQED can be associated to the simplest triangulated 4-manifold: the 4-simplex. We then begin to flesh out a dictionary between more general triangulated 4-manifolds with boundary and 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0, 2)$ interfaces. In particular, we identify IR dualities of interfaces associated to local changes of 4d triangulation, governed by the (3,3), (2,4), and (4,2) Pachner moves. We check these dualities using supersymmetric half-indices. We also describe how to produce stand-alone 2d theories (as opposed to interfaces) capturing the geometry of 4-simplices and Pachner moves by making additional field-theoretic choices, and find in this context that the Pachner moves recover abelian $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ trialities of Gadde-Gukov-Putrov. Our work provides new, explicit tools to explore the interplay between 2d dualities and 4-manifold geometry that has been developed in recent years. ",high energy physics theory

The minimal setup contains one U(1) vector multiplet and one neutral chiral multiplet parametrizing SL(2,R)/U(1) manifold, with constant superpotential and linear gauge kinetic function. In our construction the FI term is field-dependent, and one can obtain flat vanishing potential (Minkowski vacuum) with broken SUSY, and global SL(2,R) invariance (self-duality) of the bosonic equations of motion. The spectrum of the model includes a massive spin-1/2 field as well as a vector, a scalar, and a pseudo-scalar -- all classically massless. We discuss several modifications/extensions of the model as well as the introduction of matter fields. We also find a two-field extension of already existing no-scale model.

"  Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are widely used to measure the expansion of the Universe. Improving distance measurements of SNe Ia is one technique to better constrain the acceleration of expansion and determine its physical nature. This document develops a new SNe Ia spectral energy distribution (SED) model, called the SUpernova Generator And Reconstructor (SUGAR), which improves the spectral description of SNe Ia, and consequently could improve the distance measurements. This model is constructed from SNe Ia spectral properties and spectrophotometric data from The Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration. In a first step, a PCA-like method is used on spectral features measured at maximum light, which allows us to extract the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia. Next, the intrinsic properties are used to extract the average extinction curve. Third, an interpolation using Gaussian Processes facilitates using data taken at different epochs during the lifetime of a SN Ia and then projecting the data on a fixed time grid. Finally, the three steps are combined to build the SED model as a function of time and wavelength. This is the SUGAR model. The main advancement in SUGAR is the addition of two additional parameters to characterize SNe Ia variability. The first is tied to the properties of SNe Ia ejecta velocity, the second is correlated with their calcium lines. The addition of these parameters, as well as the high quality the Nearby Supernova Factory data, makes SUGAR an accurate and efficient model for describing the spectra of normal SNe Ia as they brighten and fade. The performance of this model makes it an excellent SED model for experiments like ZTF, LSST or WFIRST. ",astrophysics
"  Geometric confinements are frequently encountered in the biological world and strongly affect the stability, topology, and transport properties of active suspensions in viscous flow. Based on a far-field analytical model, the low-Reynolds-number locomotion of a self-propelled microswimmer moving inside a clean viscous drop or a drop covered with a homogeneously distributed surfactant, is theoretically examined. The interfacial viscous stresses induced by the surfactant are described by the well-established Boussinesq-Scriven constitutive rheological model. Moreover, the active agent is represented by a force dipole and the resulting fluid-mediated hydrodynamic couplings between the swimmer and the confining drop are investigated. We find that the presence of the surfactant significantly alters the dynamics of the encapsulated swimmer by enhancing its reorientation. Exact solutions for the velocity images for the Stokeslet and dipolar flow singularities inside the drop are introduced and expressed in terms of infinite series of harmonic components. Our results offer useful insights into guiding principles for the control of confined active matter systems and support the objective of utilizing synthetic microswimmers to drive drops for targeted drug delivery applications.

"  We propose a theory for the MMRD relation of novae, using free-free emission model light curves built on the optically thick wind theory. We calculated $(t_3,M_{V,\rm max})$ for various sets of $(\dot M_{\rm acc}, M_{\rm WD})$, where $M_{V,\rm max}$ is the peak absolute $V$ magnitude, $t_3$ is the 3-mag decay time from the peak, and $\dot M_{\rm acc}$ is the mass accretion rate on to the white dwarf (WD) of mass $M_{\rm WD}$. The model light curves are uniquely characterized by $x\equiv M_{\rm env}/M_{\rm sc}$, where $M_{\rm env}$ is the hydrogen-rich envelope mass and $M_{\rm sc}$ is the scaling mass at which the wind has a certain wind mass-loss rate. For a given ignition mass $M_{\rm ig}$, we can specify the first point $x_0= M_{\rm ig}/M_{\rm sc}$ on the model light curve, and calculate the corresponding peak brightness and $t_3$ time from this first point. Our $(t_3, M_{V,\rm max})$ points cover well the distribution of existing novae. The lower the mass accretion rate, the brighter the peak. The maximum brightness is limited to $M_{V,\rm max} \gtrsim -10.4$ by the lowest mass-accretion rate of $\dot M_{\rm acc} \gtrsim1 \times 10^{-11}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. A significant part of the observational MMRD trend corresponds to the $\dot M_{\rm acc}\sim5\times10^{-9}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ line with different WD masses. A scatter from the trend line indicates a variation in their mass-accretion rates. Thus, the global trend of an MMRD relation does exist, but its scatter is too large for it to be a precision distance indicator of individual novae. We tabulate $(t_3, M_{V,\rm max})$ for many sets of $(\dot M_{\rm acc},M_{\rm WD})$. ",astrophysics
"  Efficiently scaling quantum networks to long ranges requires local processing nodes to perform basic computation and communication tasks. Trapped ions have demonstrated all the properties required for the construction of such a node, storing quantum information for up to 12 minutes, implementing deterministic high fidelity logic operations on one and two qubits, and ion-photon coupling. While most ions suitable for quantum computing emit photons in visible to near ultraviolet (UV) frequency ranges poorly suited to long-distance fibre optical based networking, recent experiments in frequency conversion provide a technological solution by shifting the photons to frequencies in the telecom band with lower attenuation for fused silica fibres. Encoding qubits in frequency rather than polarization makes them more robust against decoherence from thermal or mechanical noise due to the conservation of energy. To date, ion-photonic frequency qubit entanglement has not been directly shown. Here we demonstrate a frequency encoding ion-photon entanglement protocol in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ with correlations equivalent to 92.4(8)% fidelity using a purpose-built UV hyperfine spectrometer. The same robustness against decoherence precludes our passive optical setup from rotating photonic qubits to unconditionally demonstrate entanglement, however it is sufficient to allow us to benchmark the quality of ion-UV photon correlations prior to frequency conversion to the telecom band.

"  This article investigates the energy efficiency issue in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-enhanced Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, where a mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is exploited as a flying base station to collect data from ground devices via the NOMA protocol. With the aim of maximizing network energy efficiency, we formulate a joint problem of UAV deployment, device scheduling and resource allocation. First, we formulate the joint device scheduling and spectrum allocation problem as a three-sided matching problem, and propose a novel low-complexity near-optimal algorithm. We also introduce the novel concept of `exploration' into the matching game for further performance improvement. By algorithm analysis, we prove the convergence and stability of the final matching state. Second, in an effort to allocate proper transmit power to IoT devices, we adopt the Dinkelbach's algorithm to obtain the optimal power allocation solution. Furthermore, we provide a simple but effective approach based on disk covering problem to determine the optimal number and locations of UAV's stop points to ensure that all IoT devices can be fully covered by the UAV via line-of-sight (LoS) links for the sake of better channel condition. Numerical results unveil that: i) the proposed joint UAV deployment, device scheduling and resource allocation scheme achieves much higher EE compared to predefined stationary UAV deployment case and fixed power allocation scheme, with acceptable complexity; and ii) the UAV-aided IoT networks with NOMA greatly outperforms the OMA case in terms of number of accessed devices.

This prompts the question what the origin of its underlying symmetry is. We show that it is intimately connected to general relativity: the special Galileon is the Goldstone mode of the affine group, consisting of linear coordinate transformations, analogous to the dilaton for conformal symmetries.

"  We use the measured fluxes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.0 and 11.2 $\mu$m in the reflection nebula NGC 2023 to carry out a principal component analysis (PCA) as a means to study previously reported variations in the PAH emission. We find that almost all of the variations (99%) can be explained with just two parameters -- the first two principal components (PCs). We explore the characteristics of these PCs and show that the first PC ($PC_{1}$), which is the primary driver of the variation, represents the amount of emission of a mixture of PAHs with ionized species dominating over neutral species. The second PC ($PC_{2}$) traces variations in the ionization state of the PAHs across the nebula. Correlations of the PCs with various PAH ratios show that the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m bands behave differently than the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m bands, thereby forming two distinct groups of ionized bands. We compare the spatial distribution of the PCs to the physical conditions, in particular to the strength of the radiation field, $G_{0}$, and the $G_{0}/n_{H}$ ratio and find that the variations in $PC_{2}$, i.e. the ionization state of PAHs are strongly affected by $G_{0}$ whereas the amount of PAH emission (as traced by $PC_{1}$) does not depend on $G_0$.

"  Investigating the dust heating mechanisms in galaxies provides a deeper understanding of how the internal energy balance drives their evolution. Over the last decade, radiative transfer simulations based on the Monte Carlo method have underlined the role of the various stellar populations heating the diffuse dust. Beyond the expected heating through ongoing star formation, both older stellar population (> 8Gyr) and even AGN can contribute energy to the infrared emission of diffuse dust. Here, we examine how the radiation of an external heating source, like the less massive galaxy NGC5195, in the M51 interacting system, could affect the heating of the diffuse dust of its parent galaxy, NGC5194, and vice versa. To quantify the exchange of energy between the two galaxies we use SKIRT, a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. In the interest of modelling, the assumed centre-to-centre distance separation between the two galaxies is 10kpc. Our model reproduces the global SED of the system, and it closely matches the observed images. In total, 40.7% of the intrinsic stellar radiation of the combined system is absorbed by dust. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of the various dust heating sources in the system, and find that the young stellar population of NGC5194 is the predominant dust-heating agent, with a global heating fraction of 71.2%. Another 23% is provided by the older stellar population of the same galaxy, while the remaining 5.8% has its origin in NGC5195. Locally, we find that the regions of NGC5194 closer to NGC5195 are significantly affected by the radiation field of the latter, with the absorbed energy fraction rising up to 38%. The contribution of NGC5195 remains under the percentage level in the outskirts of the disc of NGC5194. This is the first time that the heating of the diffuse dust by a companion galaxy is quantified in a nearby interacting system. ",astrophysics
"  It has been recently proposed by Maldacena and Qi that an eternal traversable wormhole in a two dimensional Anti de Sitter space (${\rm AdS}_2$) is the gravity dual of the low temperature limit of two Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models coupled by a relevant interaction (which we will refer to as spin operator). In this paper, we study spectral and eigenstate properties of this coupled SYK model. We have found that level statistics in the tail of the spectrum, and for a sufficiently weak coupling, shows substantial deviations from random matrix theory which suggests that traversable wormholes are not quantum chaotic. By contrast, for sufficiently strong coupling, corresponding to the black hole phase, level statistics are well described by random matrix theory. This transition in level statistics coincides approximately with a previously reported Hawking-Page transition for weak coupling. We have shown explicitly that this thermodynamic transition turns into a sharp crossover as the coupling increases. Likewise, this critical coupling also corresponds with the one at which the overlap between the ground state and the thermofield double state (TFD) is smallest. In the range of sizes we can reach by exact diagonalization, the ground state is well approximated by the TFD state only in the strong coupling limit. This is due to the fact that the ground state is close to the eigenstate of the spin operator corresponding to the lowest eigenvalue which is an exact TFD state at infinite temperature. In this region, the spectral density is separated into blobs centered around the eigenvalues of the spin operator. For weaker couplings, the exponential decay of coefficients in a tensor product basis, typical of the TFD, becomes power law. Finally, we have also found that the total Hamiltonian has an additional discrete symmetry which has not been reported previously. ",high energy physics theory

Notably, the conditions for the enhancement of the QZE are different when determined by the short-time or long-time behavior of the survival probability, or by the measurement strength marking the onset of the quantum Zeno regime.
