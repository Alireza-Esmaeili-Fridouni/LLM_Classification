"  The frequency-weighted model order reduction techniques are used to find a lower-order approximation of the high-order system that exhibits high-fidelity within the frequency region emphasized by the frequency weights. In this paper, we investigate the frequency-weighted H2-pseudo-optimal model order reduction problem wherein a subset of the optimality conditions for the local optimum is attempted to be satisfied. We propose two iteration-free algorithms, for the single-sided frequency-weighted case of H2-model reduction, where a subset of the optimality conditions is ensured by the reduced system. In addition, the reduced systems retain the stability property of the original system. We also present an iterative algorithm for the double-sided frequency-weighted case, which constructs a reduced-order model that tends to satisfy a subset of the first-order optimality conditions for the local optimum. The proposed algorithm is computationally efficient as compared to the existing algorithms. We validate the theory developed in this paper on three numerical examples.

"  Let $1\le p<\infty$. A symmetric space $X$ on $[0,1]$ is said to be $p$-disjointly homogeneous (resp. restricted $p$-disjointly homogeneous) if every sequence of normalized pairwise disjoint functions from $X$ (resp. characteristic functions) contains a subsequence equivalent in $X$ to the unit vector basis of $l_p$. Answering a question posed recently, we construct, for each $1\le p<\infty$, a restricted $p$-disjointly homogeneous symmetric space, which is not $p$-disjointly homogeneous. Moreover, we prove that the property of $p$-disjoint homogeneity is preserved under Banach isomorphisms. ",mathematics
"  After extensively explored, broad agreement between observations and theories has been reached that satellites are preferentially aligned with major axes of their host centrals. There are still some issues unsolved on this topic. In this paper, we present studies on satellite spatial distribution. To fairly compare with observations, we develop a novel galaxy finder and reconstruction algorithm in hydrodynamical simulation, which is based on the projected mock image, taking into account the full consideration of the point spread function, pixel size, surface brightness limit, resolution and redshift dimming effects. With galaxy samples constructed using such an algorithm, the satellite alignment is examined by comparing with observational results. It is found that the observational alignment can be reproduced for red galaxies, which dominate the sample in this study, but not for blue galaxies. Satellites' radial distribution is also investigated. It exhibits that outer satellites within host halos show stronger alignment signal than satellites in the inner regions, especially for red satellites, which is in contrast with previous studies. The disagreement is mainly due to extra galaxies identified by our new galaxy finder, which are mainly located in the inner region of host halos. Our study illustrates that at lower redshift, the alignment strength becomes stronger, while radial distribution curve becomes flatter. This suggests differences in the evolution of the angular distribution between satellites residing in the inner and outer halos, and implies that the post-infall evolution reduces the original alignment signal, that the impact decreases for satellites with later infall times.

"  We calculate a sheaf line in CP^3 which is the real line supporting sheaf points on CP^3 of SL(2,C) Yang-Mills instanton (or SU(2) complex Yang-Mills instanton) sheaves for some given ADHM data we obtained previously. We found that this sheaf line is indeed a special jumping line over S^4 spacetime. In addition, we calculate the singularity structure of the connection A and the field strength F at the corresponding singular point on S^4 of this sheaf line. We found that the order of singularity at the singular point on S^4 associated with the sheaf line in CP^3 is higher than those of other singular points associated with normal jumping lines. We conjecture that this is a general feature for sheaf lines among jumping lines. ",high energy physics theory
"  In circular accelerators, crossing the linear coupling resonance induces the exchange of the transverse emittances, provided the process is adiabatic. This has been considered in some previous works, where the description of the phenomenon has been laid down, and, more recently, where a possible explanation of the numerical results has been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework to analyze the crossing process, based on the theory of adiabatic invariance for Hamiltonian mechanics, which explains in detail various features of the emittance exchange process.

"  Turbulent flows, ubiquitous in nature and engineering, comprise fluctuations over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. While flows with fluctuations in thermodynamic variables are much more common, much less is known about these flows than their incompressible counterparts in which thermodynamics is decoupled from hydrodynamics. A critical element in the study of the latter has been the concept of universal scaling laws which provides fundamental as well as practical information about the spatio-temporal behavior of these complex systems. Part of this success is due to the dependence on a single non-dimensional parameter, that is the Reynolds number. Universality in compressible flows, on the other hand, have proven to be more elusive as no unifying set of parameters were found to yield universal scaling laws. This severely limits our understanding of these flows and the successful development of theoretically sound models. Using results in specific asymptotic limits of the governing equations we show that universal scaling is indeed observed when the set of governing parameters is expanded to include internally generated dilatational scales which are the result of the driving mechanisms that produce the turbulence. The analysis demonstrate why previous scaling laws fail in the general case, and opens up new venues to identify physical processes of interest and create turbulence models needed for simulations of turbulent flows at realistic conditions. We support our results with a new massive database of highly-resolved direct numerical simulations along with all data available in the literature. In search of universal features, we suggest classes which bundle the evolution of flows in the new parameter space. An ultimate asymptotic regime predicted independently by renormalization group theories and statistical mechanics is also assssed with available data. ",physics
"  In this article, we present some new general forms of numerical radius inequalities for Hilbert space operators. The significance of these inequalities follow from the way they extend and refine some known results in this field. Among other inequalities, it is shown that if $A$ is a bounded linear operator on a complex Hilbert space, then \[{{w}^{2}}\left( A \right)\le \left\| \int_{0}^{1}{{{\left( t\left| A \right|+\left( 1-t \right)\left| {{A}^{*}} \right| \right)}^{2}}dt} \right\|\le \frac{1}{2}\left\| \;{{\left| A \right|}^{2}}+{{\left| {{A}^{*}} \right|}^{2}} \right\|\] where $w\left( A \right)$ and $\left\| A \right\|$ are the numerical radius and the usual operator norm of $A$, respectively.

"  For a holomorphic function $f$ in the open unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ and $\zeta\in\mathbb{D}$, $S_n(f,\zeta)$ denotes the $n$-th partial sum of the Taylor development of $f$ at $\zeta$. Given an increasing sequence of positive integers $\mu=(\mu_n)$, we consider the classes $\mathcal{U}(\mathbb{D},\zeta)$ (resp. $\mathcal{U}^{(\mu)}(\mathbb{D},\zeta)$) of such functions $f$ such that the partial sums $\{S_n(f,\zeta):n=1,2,\dots\}$ (resp. $\{S_{\mu_n}(f,\zeta):n=1,2,\dots\}$) approximate all polynomials uniformly on the compact sets $K\subset\{z\in\mathbb{C}:\vert z\vert\geq 1\}$ with connected complement. We show that these two classes of universal Taylor series coincide if and only if $\limsup_n\left(\frac{\mu_{n+1}}{\mu_n}\right)<+\infty$. In the same spirit, we prove that, for $\zeta\ne 0,$ we have the equality $\mathcal{U}^{(\mu)}(\mathbb{D},\zeta)=\mathcal{U}^{(\mu)}(\mathbb{D},0)$ if and only if $\limsup_n\left(\frac{\mu_{n+1}}{\mu_n}\right)<+\infty$.

"  Formation and evolution of topological defects in course of non-equilibrium symmetry breaking phase transitions is of wide interest in many areas of physics, from cosmology through condensed matter to low temperature physics. Its study in strongly coupled systems, in absence of quasiparticles, is especially challenging. We investigate breaking of U(1) symmetry and the resulting spontaneous formation of vortices in a $(2+1)$-dimensional holographic superconductor employing gauge/gravity duality, a `first-principles' approach to study strongly coupled systems. Magnetic fluxons with quantized fluxes are seen emerging in the post-transition superconducting phase. As expected in type II superconductors, they are trapped in the cores of the order parameter vortices. The dependence of the density of these topological defects on the quench time, the dispersion of the typical winding numbers in the superconductor, and the vortex-vortex correlations are consistent with predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism.

"  In 1993 David Vogan proposed a basis for the vector space of stable distributions on $p$-adic groups using the microlocal geometry of moduli spaces of Langlands parameters. In the case of general linear groups, distribution characters of irreducible admissible representations, taken up to equivalence, form a basis for the vector space of stable distributions. In this paper we show that these two bases, one putative, cannot be equal. Specifically, we use the Kashiwara-Saito singularity to find a non-Arthur type irreducible admissible representation of $p$-adic $\mathop{GL}_{16}$ whose ABV-packet, as defined in earlier work, contains exactly one other representation; remarkably, this other admissible representation is of Arthur type. In the course of this study we strengthen the main result concerning the Kashiwara-Saito singularity. The irreducible admissible representations in this paper illustrate a fact we found surprising: for general linear groups, while all A-packets are singletons, some ABV-packets are not. ",mathematics

"  We consider time-dependent orbifolds in String Theory and we show that divergences are not associated with a gravitational backreaction since they appear in the open string sector too. They are related to the non existence of the underlying effective field theory as in several cases fourth and higher order contact terms do not exist. Since contact terms may arise from the exchange of string massive states, we investigate and show that some three points amplitudes with one massive state in the open string sector are divergent on the time-dependent orbifolds. To check that divergences are associated with the existence of a discrete zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the subspace with vanishing volume, we construct the Generalized Null Boost Orbifold where this phenomenon can be turned on and off.

"  Boundaries in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal theories may preserve one half of the original bulk supersymmetry. There are two possibilities which are characterized by the chirality of the leftover supercharges. Depending on the choice, the remaining $2d$ boundary algebra exhibits $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ or $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry. In this work we focus on correlation functions of chiral fields for both types of supersymmetric boundaries. We study a host of correlators using superspace techniques and calculate superconformal blocks for two- and three-point functions. For $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry, some of our results can be analytically continued in the spacetime dimension while keeping the codimension fixed. This opens the door for a bootstrap analysis of the $\epsilon$-expansion in supersymmetric BCFTs. Armed with our analytically-continued superblocks, we prove that in the free theory limit two-point functions of chiral (and antichiral) fields are unique. The first order correction, which already describes interactions, is universal up to two free parameters. As a check of our analysis, we study the Wess-Zumino model with a supersymmetric boundary using Feynman diagrams, and find perfect agreement between the perturbative and bootstrap results.

"  We present the Forgotten Quadrant Survey (FQS), an ESO large project that used the 12m antenna of the Arizona Radio Observatory to map the Galactic Plane in the range 220\deg$<l<$240\deg and -2.5\deg$<b<$0\deg, both in $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0), at a spectral resolution of 0.65 km s$^{-1}$ and 0.26 km s$^{-1}$. Our dataset allows us to easily identify how the molecular dense gas is organised at different spatial scales: from the giant clouds with their denser filamentary networks, down to the clumps and cores that host the newborn stars and to obtain reliable estimates of their key physical parameters. We present the first release of the FQS data and discuss their quality. Spectra with 0.65 km s$^{-1}$ velocity channels have a noise ranging from 0.8 K to 1.3 K for $^{12}$CO(1-0) and from 0.3 K to 0.6 K for $^{13}$CO(1-0). In this paper, we used the $^{12}$CO(1-0) spectral cubes to produce a catalogue of 263 molecular clouds. This is the first selfconsistent, statistical catalogue of molecular clouds of the outer Galaxy, obtained with a subarcminute spatial resolution and therefore able to detect not only the classical giant molecular clouds, but also the small clouds and to resolve the cloud structure at the subparsec scale up to a distance of a few kpc. We found two classes of objects: structures with size above a few parsecs that are typical molecular clouds and may be self-gravitating, and subparsec structures that cannot be in gravitational equilibrium and are likely transient or confined by external pressure. We used the ratio between the Herschel H$_2$ column density and the integrated intensity of the CO lines to calculate the CO conversion factor and we found mean values of (3.3$\pm$1.4)$\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$(K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$ and (1.2$\pm$0.4)$\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$(K km s$^{-1})^{-1}$, for $^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{13}$CO(1-0), respectively.

"  Quantum Optical Coherence Tomography (Q-OCT) presents many advantages over its classical counterpart, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT): it provides an increased axial resolution and is immune to even orders of dispersion. The core of Q-OCT is quantum interference of negatively correlated entangled photon pairs obtained in a Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. This two-photon interference can be observed in the time domain in the form of dips or in the Fourier domain by means of a joint spectrum. The latter approach proved to be practical in the sense that it alleviated the requirement posed on light in Q-OCT to exhibit strict negative correlations, since the negative correlations can be easily extracted in the Fourier domain as the main diagonal of the joint spectrum. In this work, we investigate the use of this spectral approach in which quantum interference is obtained with classical low-intensity light pulses. We report theoretical calculations and their experimental validation and show that although such classical light is much easier to launch into an experimental system, it offers limited benefits as compared to Q-OCT based on entangled light. We analyse the differences in the characteristics of the joint spectrum obtained with entangled photons and with classical light and explain the origins of these differences. ",quantum physics

"  We propose a novel electron acceleration mechanism, which we call stochastic shock drift acceleration (SSDA), that extends the standard shock drift acceleration (SDA) for low-energy electrons at a quasi-perpendicular shock to include the effect of stochastic pitch-angle scattering. We demonstrate that the steady-state energy spectrum of electrons accelerated within the shock transition region becomes a power-law in the limit of strong scattering. The spectral index is independent of the pitch-angle scattering coefficient. On the other hand, the maximum energy attainable through the mechanism scales linearly with the pitch-angle scattering coefficient. These results have been confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations that include finite pitch-angle anisotropy. We find that the theory can reasonably well explain in-situ observations of quasi-perpendicular Earth's bow shock. Theoretical scaling law suggests that the maximum energy increases in proportion to the square of the shock speed, indicating that the thermal electrons may be accelerated up to mildly relativistic energies by the SSDA at quasi-perpendicular supernova remnant shocks. Therefore, the mechanism provides a plausible solution to the long-standing electron injection problem. ",astrophysics

"  Let $F_n$ be a free group of finite rank $n \geq 2$. We prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $F_n$ with $\textrm{rk}(H)=2$ and $R$ is a retract of $F_n$, then $H \cap R$ is a retract of $H$. However, for every $m \geq 3$ and every $1 \leq k \leq n-1$, there exist a subgroup $H$ of $F_n$ of rank $m$ and a retract $R$ of $F_n$ of rank $k$ such that $H \cap R$ is not a retract of $H$. This gives a complete answer to a question of Bergman.   Furthermore, we provide positive evidence for the inertia conjecture of Dicks and Ventura. More precisely, we prove that $\textrm{rk}(H \cap \textrm{Fix}(S)) \leq \textrm{rk}(H)$ for every family $S$ of endomorphisms of $F_n$ and every subgroup $H$ of $F_n$ with $\textrm{rk}(H) \leq 3$.

"  In Part 2 of our guide to collisionless fluid models, we concentrate on Landau fluid closures. These closures were pioneered by Hammett and Perkins and allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless Landau damping into a fluid framework. It is Landau damping that sharply separates traditional fluid models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual fluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the long-wavelength low-frequency limit. We start with a brief introduction to kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function $Z(\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $R(\zeta)=1+\zeta Z(\zeta)=-Z'(\zeta)/2$. We then consider a 1D (electrostatic) geometry and make a significant effort to map all possible Landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the 4th-order moment level. These closures for parallel moments have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the Debye length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and electron) Landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron Landau damping of the Langmuir mode. We proceed by considering 1D closures at higher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in Part 1, this is not possible without Landau fluid closures. We show that it is possible to reproduce linear Landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired precision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic descriptions. We then consider a 3D (electromagnetic) geometry in the gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are available at the 4th-order moment level. In the Appendix A, we provide comprehensive tables with Pad\'e approximants of $R(\zeta)$ up to the 8th-pole order, with many given in an analytic form. ",physics
"  Long prediction horizons in Model Predictive Control (MPC) often prove to be efficient, however, this comes with increased computational cost. Recently, a Robust Model Predictive Control (RMPC) method has been proposed which exploits models of different granularity. The prediction over the control horizon is split into short-term predictions with a detailed model using MPC and long-term predictions with a coarse model using RMPC. In many applications robustness is required for the short-term future, but in the long-term future, subject to major uncertainty and potential modeling difficulties, robust planning can lead to highly conservative solutions. We therefore propose combining RMPC on a detailed model for short-term predictions and Stochastic MPC (SMPC), with chance constraints, on a simplified model for long-term predictions. This yields decreased computational effort due to a simple model for long-term predictions, and less conservative solutions, as robustness is only required for short-term predictions. The effectiveness of the method is shown in a mobile robot collision avoidance simulation. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We prove joint universality theorems on the half plane of absolute convergence for general classes of Dirichlet series with an Euler-product, where in addition to vertical shifts we also allow scaling. This generalizes our recent joint universality results for Dirichlet $L$-functions. In contrast to classical universality, we do not need that the Dirichlet series in question have an analytic continuation beyond their region of absolute convergence. Also we may allow weaker orthogonality conditions for pairs of Dirichlet series than in the previous joint universality results of Lee-Nakamura-Pa\'{n}kowski. We take care to avoid using the Ramanujan conjecture in our proof and hence as a consequence of our universality theorem, we obtain stronger results on zeros of linear combinations of $L$-functions in the half plane of absolute convergence than previous results of Booker-Thorne and Righetti. For example as a consequence of our main universality result we have that certain linear combinations of Hecke $L$-series coming from Maass wave forms have infinitely many zeros in any strip $1<$Re$(s)<1+\delta$.

We accomplish this by wrapping local observations in a linear code and intentionally applying symbol errors prior to transmission. If many nodes join the distributed task, a proportional number of symbol errors are introduced into the code leading to decoding failure if the code's predefined symbol error limit is exceeded.

"  Terminal ductal lobular unit (TDLU) involution is the regression of milk-producing structures in the breast. Women with less TDLU involution are more likely to develop breast cancer. A major bottleneck in studying TDLU involution in large cohort studies is the need for labor-intensive manual assessment of TDLUs. We developed a computational pathology solution to automatically capture TDLU involution measures. Whole slide images (WSIs) of benign breast biopsies were obtained from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). A first set of 92 WSIs was annotated for TDLUs, acini and adipose tissue to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models for detection of acini, and segmentation of TDLUs and adipose tissue. These networks were integrated into a single computational method to capture TDLU involution measures including number of TDLUs per tissue area, median TDLU span and median number of acini per TDLU. We validated our method on 40 additional WSIs by comparing with manually acquired measures. Our CNN models detected acini with an F1 score of 0.73$\pm$0.09, and segmented TDLUs and adipose tissue with Dice scores of 0.86$\pm$0.11 and 0.86$\pm$0.04, respectively. The inter-observer ICC scores for manual assessments on 40 WSIs of number of TDLUs per tissue area, median TDLU span, and median acini count per TDLU were 0.71, 95% CI [0.51, 0.83], 0.81, 95% CI [0.67, 0.90], and 0.73, 95% CI [0.54, 0.85], respectively.

We find new classes of orders on which testing isomorphism or counting the number of linear extensions can be done in polynomial time. We also present a generalization of questionable-width, called balanced tree-questionable-width, and show that if a class of binary structures has bounded tree-width or clique-width, then it has bounded balanced tree-questionable-width. But there are classes of graphs of bounded balanced tree-questionable-width and unbounded tree-width or clique-width. ",mathematics

We argue that the new Abelian picture provides a reliable description of T-branes when their non-Abelian fields have large expectation values in string units. To confirm this duality, we match the energy density and all the electromagnetic couplings on both sides.

These two types of singularities are tightly related to each other, but the exact mapping is not well understood. In this paper, we have initiated the systematic study of the mapping.

  We consider the problem of quantum phase estimation with access to arbitrary measurements in a single suboptimal basis. The achievable sensitivity limit in this case is determined by the classical Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound with respect to the fixed basis. Here we show that the sensitivity can be enhanced beyond this limit if knowledge about the energy expectation value is available. The combined information is shown to be equivalent to a direct measurement of an optimal linear combination of the basis projectors and the phase-imprinting Hamiltonian. Application to an atomic clock with oversqueezed spin states yields a sensitivity gain that scales linearly with the number of atoms. Our analysis further reveals that small modifications of the observable can have a strong impact on the sensitivity. ,quantum physics

"  We present Period-Luminosity and Period-Luminosity-Color relations at maximum-light for Mira variables in the Magellanic Clouds using time-series data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-III) and {\it Gaia} data release 2. The maximum-light relations exhibit a scatter typically up to $\sim 30\%$ smaller than their mean-light counterparts. The apparent magnitudes of Oxygen-rich Miras at maximum-light display significantly smaller cycle-to-cycle variations than at minimum-light. High-precision photometric data for Kepler Mira candidates also exhibit stable magnitude variations at the brightest epochs while their multi-epoch spectra display strong Balmer emission lines and weak molecular absorption at maximum-light. The stability of maximum-light magnitudes for Miras possibly occurs due to the decrease in the sensitivity to molecular bands at their warmest phase. At near-infrared wavelengths, the Period-Luminosity relations of Miras display similar dispersion at mean and maximum-light with limited time-series data in the Magellanic Clouds. A kink in the Oxygen-rich Mira Period-Luminosity relations is found at 300 days in the $VI$-bands which shifts to longer-periods ($\sim 350$~days) at near-infrared wavelengths. Oxygen-rich Mira Period-Luminosity relations at maximum-light provide a relative distance modulus, $\Delta \mu = 0.48\pm0.08$~mag, between the Magellanic Clouds with a smaller statistical uncertainty than the mean-light relations. The maximum-light properties of Miras can be very useful for stellar atmosphere modeling and distance scale studies provided their stability and the universality can be established in other stellar environments in the era of extremely large telescopes.

"  In this paper, an efficient massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detector is proposed by employing a deep neural network (DNN). Specifically, we first unfold an existing iterative detection algorithm into the DNN structure, such that the detection task can be implemented by deep learning (DL) approach. We then introduce two auxiliary parameters at each layer to better cancel multiuser interference (MUI). The first parameter is to generate the residual error vector while the second one is to adjust the relationship among previous layers. We further design the training procedure to optimize the auxiliary parameters with pre-processed inputs. The so derived MIMO detector falls into the category of model-driven DL. The simulation results show that the proposed MIMO detector can achieve preferable detection performance compared to the existing detectors for massive MIMO systems.

"  From a physical/dynamical system perspective, the potential well represents the proportional mass of points that escape the neighbourhood of a given point. In the last 20 years, several works have shown the importance of this quantity to obtain precise approximations for several recurrence time distributions in mixing stochastic processes and dynamical systems. Besides providing a review of the different scaling factors used in the literature in recurrence times, the present work contributes with two new results: (1) for $\phi$-mixing and $\psi$-mixing processes, we give a new exponential approximation for hitting and return times using the potential well as scaling parameter. The error terms are explicit and sharp. (2) We analyse the uniform positivity of the potential well. ",mathematics
"  We introduce a novel methodology for establishing the presence of Standing Accretion Shock Instabilities (SASI) in the dynamics of a core collapse supernova from the observed neutrino event rate at water- or ice-based neutrino detectors. The methodology uses a likelihood ratio in the frequency domain as a test-statistics; it is also employed to assess the potential to estimate the frequency and the amplitude of the SASI modulations of the neutrino signal. The parameter estimation errors are consistent with the minimum possible errors as evaluated from the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, and close to the theoretical minimum for the SASI amplitude. Using results from a core-collapse simulation of a 15 solar-mass star by Kuroda $\it {et\, al.}$ (2017) as a test bed for the method, we find that SASI can be identified with high confidence for a distance to the supernova of up to $\sim 6$ kpc for IceCube and and up to $\sim 3$ kpc for a 0.4 Mt mass water Cherenkov detector. This methodology will aid the investigation of a future galactic supernova. ",astrophysics
"  Today, the near-Earth space is facing a paradigm change as the number of new spacecraft is literally sky-rocketing. Increasing numbers of small satellites threaten the sustainable use of space, as without removal, space debris will eventually make certain critical orbits unusable. A central factor affecting small spacecraft health and leading to debris is the radiation environment, which is unpredictable due to an incomplete understanding of the near-Earth radiation environment itself and its variability driven by the solar wind and outer magnetosphere. This paper presents the FORESAIL-1 nanosatellite mission, having two scientific and one technological objectives. The first scientific objective is to measure the energy and flux of energetic particle loss to the atmosphere with a representative energy and pitch angle resolution over a wide range of magnetic local times. To pave the way to novel model - in situ data comparisons, we also show preliminary results on precipitating electron fluxes obtained with the new global hybrid-Vlasov simulation Vlasiator. The second scientific objective of the FORESAIL-1 mission is to measure energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) of solar origin. The solar ENA flux has the potential to contribute importantly to the knowledge of solar eruption energy budget estimations. The technological objective is to demonstrate a satellite de-orbiting technology, and for the first time, make an orbit manoeuvre with a propellantless nanosatellite. FORESAIL-1 will demonstrate the potential for nanosatellites to make important scientific contributions as well as promote the sustainable utilisation of space by using a cost-efficient de-orbiting technology.

"  In this study, the development of an automatic algorithm is presented to classify the nocturnal audio recording of an obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patient as OSA related snore, simple snore and other sounds. Recent studies has been shown that knowledge regarding the OSA related snore could assist in identifying the site of airway collapse. Audio signal was recorded simultaneously with full-night polysomnography during sleep with a ceiling microphone. Time and frequency features of the nocturnal audio signal were extracted to classify the audio signal into OSA related snore, simple snore and other sounds. Two algorithms were developed to extract OSA related snore using an linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier based on the hypothesis that OSA related snoring can assist in identifying the site-of-upper airway collapse. An unbiased nested leave-one patient-out cross-validation process was used to select a high performing feature set from the full set of features. Results indicated that the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 87% for identifying snore events from the audio recordings and an accuracy of 72% for identifying OSA related snore events from the snore events. The direct method to extract OSA-related snore events using a multi-class LDA classifier achieved an accuracy of 64% using the feature selection algorithm. Our results gives a clear indication that OSA-related snore events can be extracted from nocturnal sound recordings, and therefore could potentially be used as a new tool for identifying the site of airway collapse from the nocturnal audio recordings.

"  The original definition of amenability given by von Neumann in the highly non-constructive terms of means was later recast by Day using approximately invariant probability measures. Moreover, as it was conjectured by Furstenberg and proved by Kaimanovich-Vershik and Rosenblatt, the amenability of a locally compact group is actually equivalent to the existence of a single probability measure on the group with the property that the sequence of its convolution powers is asymptotically invariant. In the present article we extend this characterization of amenability to measured groupoids. It implies, in particular, that the amenability of a measure class preserving group action is equivalent to the existence of a random environment on the group parameterized by the action space, and such that the tail of the random walk in almost every environment is trivial.

"  Renormalization group methods are an essential ingredient in the study of nonperturbative problems of quantum field theory. This paper deal with the symmetry constraints on the renormalization group flow for quartic melonic tensorial group field theories. Using the unitary invariance of the interactions, we provide a set of Ward-Takahashi identities which leads to relations between correlation functions. There are numerous reasons to consider such Ward identities in the functional renormalization group. Their compatibility along the flow provides a non-trivial constraint on the reliability of the approximation schemes used in the non-perturbative regime, especially on the truncation and the choice of the regulator. We establish the so called structure equations in the melonic sector and in the symmetric phase. As an example we consider the $T^4_5$ TGFT model without gauge constraint. The Wetterich flow equation is given and the way to improve the truncation on the effective action is also scrutinized. ",high energy physics theory
"  Ward-Takahashi identities are nonperturbative relations between correlation functions and arising from symmetries in quantum and statistical fields theories, as Noether currents conservation for classical theories. Since their historical origin, these identities were considered to prove the exact relation between counter-terms to all order of the perturbative expansion. Recently they have been considered in relation with nonperturbative renormalization group aspects for some classes of quantum field theories namely tensorial group field theories and matrix models, both characterized by a specific non-locality in their interactions, and expected to provide discrete models for quantum gravity.

"  The AdS/CFT correspondence is one of the most important discoveries in theoretical physics in recent years. It states that certain quantum mechanical theories can actually be described by classical gravity in one higher dimension, in a spacetime called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. What makes this duality so useful is that it relates theories with weak coupling to theories with strong coupling and thus provides a new tool for tackling strongly coupled quantum field theories, which are notoriously difficult to handle using conventional methods. During the course of my PhD I have mostly studied time dependent processes, in particular thermalization processes, in quantum field theories using the AdS/CFT correspondence. On the gravity side, this is dual to dynamical formation of black holes from the collapse of matter fields. By studying the gravitational collapse process in detail, we can then draw conclusions about the dynamical formation of a thermal state in the dual quantum field theory. Using mostly numerical methods, I have studied how confinement affects thermalization in quantum field theories, where the system may never thermalize and field theory observables undergo interesting quasiperiodic behaviour. I have also studied formation of black holes in three dimensions which due to the simplified nature of three-dimensional gravity can be done using analytical methods. This has led to the discovery of new solutions of three-dimensional gravity corresponding to the formation of black holes without spherical symmetry, which can provide a deeper understanding of thermalization in two-dimensional quantum field theories. In a third line of research, I have studied higher spin gravity in three dimensions, an exotic extension of three-dimensional gravity which includes fields with spin higher than two, and we outline a new method to construct black hole solutions carrying higher spin charge.

"  Moduli spaces - finite-dimensional, collective coordinate manifolds - for kinks and antikinks in $\phi^4$ theory and sine-Gordon theory are reconsidered. The field theory Lagrangian restricted to moduli space defines a reduced Lagrangian, combining a potential with a kinetic term that can be interpreted as a Riemannian metric on moduli space. Moduli spaces should be metrically complete, or have an infinite potential on their boundary. Examples are constructed for both kink-antikink and kink-antikink-kink configurations. The naive position coordinates of the kinks and antikinks sometimes need to be extended from real to imaginary values, although the field remains real. The previously discussed null-vector problem for the shape modes of $\phi^4$ kinks is resolved by a better coordinate choice. In sine-Gordon theory, moduli spaces can be constructed using exact solutions at the critical energy separating scattering and breather (or wobble) solutions; here, energy conservation relates the metric and potential. The reduced dynamics on these moduli spaces accurately reproduces properties of the exact solutions over a range of energies. ",high energy physics theory

The defining relations of the corresponding nilpotent Lie algebra for type $A_1, A_2,A_3,A_4$ are given here. ",mathematics
"  We propose a hybrid feedback control law that guarantees both safety and asymptotic stability for a class of Lagrangian systems in environments with obstacles. Rather than performing trajectory planning and implementing a trajectory-tracking feedback control law, our approach requires a sequence of locations in the environment (a path plan) and an abstraction of the obstacle-free space. The problem of following a path plan is then interpreted as a sequence of reach-avoid problems: the system is required to consecutively reach each location of the path plan while staying within safe regions. Obstacle-free ellipsoids are used as a way of defining such safe regions, each of which encloses two consecutive locations. Feasible Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are created directly from geometric constraints, the ellipsoids, ensuring forward-invariance, and therefore safety. Reachability to each location is guaranteed by asymptotically stabilizing Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs). Both CBFs and CLFs are then encoded into quadratic programs (QPs) without the need of relaxation variables. Furthermore, we also propose a switching mechanism that guarantees the control law is correct and well-defined even when transitioning between QPs. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in two complex scenarios. ",mathematics
"  We derive an expression for the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loop of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang Mills in terms of color invariants, valid for any representation R of any gauge group G. This expression allows us to discuss various exact relations among vevs in different representations. We also display the reduction of these color invariants to simpler ones, up to seventh order in perturbation theory, and verify that the resulting expression is considerably simpler for the logarithm of $\left<W\right>_R$ than for $\left<W\right>_R$ itself. We find that in the particular case of the symmetric and antisymmetric representations of SU(N), the logarithm of $\left<W\right>_R$ satisfies a quadratic Casimir factorization up to seventh order, and argue that this property holds to all orders. Finally, we derive the large N expansion of $\left<W\right>_R$ for an arbitrary, but fixed, representation of SU(N), up to order $1/\text{N}^2$. ",high energy physics theory

To fully explore the performance of MT-GP, we perform two case studies - one using purely computational datasets and the other using a combination of experimental and computational datasets. In both cases, the performance of MT-GPs is significantly better than single-task models built on a single data source. This method can be used to learn improved models from fused datasets, and thereby build accurate models under tight computational and experimental budget. ",physics
"  We use the monodromy method to compute expectation values of an arbitrary number of light operators in finitely excited (""heavy"") eigenstates of holographic 2D CFT. For eigenstates with scaling dimensions above the BTZ threshold, these behave thermally up to small corrections, with an effective temperature determined by the heavy state. Below the threshold we find oscillatory and not decaying behavior. As an application of these results we compute the expectation of the out-of-time order arrangement of four light operators in a heavy eigenstate, i.e. a six-point function. Above the threshold we find maximally scrambling behavior with Lyapunov exponent $2\pi T_{\rm eff}$. Below threshold we find that the eigenstate OTOC shows persistent harmonic oscillations.

"  Photosynthesis converts sunlight into the chemical free energy that feeds the Earth's biosphere, yet at levels much lower than what thermodynamics would allow for. I propose here that photosynthesis is nevertheless thermodynamically limited, but this limit acts indirectly on the material exchange of water and carbon dioxide. I substantiate this interpretation using global observation-based datasets of radiation, photosynthesis, precipitation and evaporation. I first calculate the conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems and its climatological variation, with a median efficiency of 0.78% (n = 13445). The rates tightly correlate with evaporation (r2 = 0.89), which demonstrates the importance of the coupling of photosynthesis to material exchange. I then infer evaporation from the maximum material exchange between the surface and the atmosphere that is thermodynamically possible using datasets of solar radiation and precipitation. This inferred rate closely correlates with the observation-based evaporation dataset (r2 = 0.85). When this rate is converted back into photosynthetic activity, the resulting patterns correlate highly with the observation-based dataset (r2 = 0.56). This supports the interpretation that it is not energy directly that limits terrestrial photosynthesis, but rather the material exchange that is driven by sunlight. This interpretation can explain the very low, observed conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems as well as its spatial variations. More generally, this implies that one needs to take the necessary material flows and exchanges associated with life into account to understand the thermodynamics of life. This, ultimately, requires a perspective that links the activity of the biosphere to the thermodynamic constraints of transport processes in the Earth system. ",physics
"  Predicting commuting flows based on infrastructure and land-use information is critical for urban planning and public policy development. However, it is a challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby regions. To address these issues, we propose Geo-contextual Multitask Embedding Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are used to model supply and demand characteristics. A multitask learning framework is used to introduce stronger restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of the embedding representation. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model using real-world datasets from New York City and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state of the art. ",physics
"  The relationship between velocities, tractions, and intercellular stresses in the migrating epithelial monolayer are currently unknown. Ten years ago, a method known as Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) was suggested from which the intercellular stresses could be computed given a traction field. The core assumption of MSM is that the intercellular stresses within the monolayer behave similarly to passive systems like a Hookean solid (an elastic sheet) or a Newtonian fluid (thin fluid film), implying a relation between the displacements/velocities and tractions. Due to the lack of independently measured intercellular stresses, validation of MSM is difficult. An alternative approach, which we give here, is based on simultaneous measurements of the monolayer velocity field and the cell/substrate tractions. With limited assumptions, the velocity field suffices to compute tractions, which we can then compare directly with those measured by traction force microscopy. We find that the calculated tractions and measured tractions are uncorrelated. Since both classical MSM and a purely viscous description of the relation between displacements or velocities and tractions depends on a linear constitutive law, it follows that some modification of these approaches is needed. One possible resolution is the inclusion of an active force. To this end, we give a new relationship between the active force density and the measured velocity(or displacement) field, and tractions, which by Newton's laws, must be obeyed. ",physics

The high proportion of motile cells enhances dispersion rather than aggregation. ",physics

"  The theory of angular momentum connects physical rotations and quantum spins together at a fundamental level. Physical rotation of a quantum system will therefore affect fundamental quantum operations, such as spin rotations in projective Hilbert space, but these effects are subtle and experimentally challenging to observe due to the fragility of quantum coherence. Here we report a measurement of a single-electron-spin phase shift arising directly from physical rotation, without transduction through magnetic fields or ancillary spins. This phase shift is observed by measuring the phase difference between a microwave driving field and a rotating two-level electron spin system, and can accumulate nonlinearly in time. We detect the nonlinear phase using spin-echo interferometry of a single nitrogen-vacancy qubit in a diamond rotating at 200,000rpm.

"  In this paper, we investigate the holographic complexity in the charged Taub-NUT-AdS black holes with Misner strings present in the Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We show that differing from the normal black holes, where the late-time complexity growth rate is only determined by the quantities at outer and inner ``Reissner-Nordstrom''-type (RN-type) horizons, here the quantities (the Misner potential and Misner charge) related to the Misner strings also play an important role in CA complexity. Similar to the case of the normal electromagnetic black hole, the late-time rate for the original CA conjecture is independent on the magnetic charges. However, disparate with common results of the dyonic solutions, the electric charge appeared here is the total charge of this black hole. Besides, we found that the result in this original CA conjecture also violates the electromagnetic duality. And this duality can be restored by adding the Maxwell boundary term with the proportional constant $\g=1/2$. In this case, the late-time rate is sensitive to the magnetic charge. Moreover, we also found that the additional term only changes the proportion between the electric and magnetic charges, and it does not affect the Misner term appeared in the late-time rate. Finally, we studied the time-dependence of the complexity growth rate and found that they share similar behaviors with that in RN-AdS black holes. ",high energy physics theory
"  Invoking increasingly higher dimension operators to encode novel UV physics in effective gauge and gravity theories traditionally means working with increasingly more finicky and difficult expressions.

We exploit that Jacobi-satisfying representations can be composed out of other Jacobi-satisfying representations, and show that at four-points only a small number of building blocks are required to generate the predictions of higher-derivative operators. We find that this construction saturates the higher-derivative operators contributing to the four-point supersymmetric open and closed-string tree amplitudes, presenting a novel representation of the four-point supersymmetric open string making this structure manifest, as well as identifying the only four additional gauge-invariant building blocks required to saturate the four-point bosonic open string.

"  A particle detection system that exploits the scintillation light produced by ionizing particles in liquid argon (LAr) has been assembled at CERN. The system is based on 10 large-area photomultiplier tubes (PMT) immersed in a 1500-liter dewar filled with liquid argon and equipped with an extendible feed-through and mechanical support for an alpha source (241Am). The position of the source can be changed with respect to the PMT plane in vertical and horizontal directions. Arrays of silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) photodetectors, integrated in the source support, are used for the data acquisition trigger and to define the t0 of the light generation. PMT and SiPM signals can be recorded at different distances and different positions allowing the measurement of some of the LAr scintillation light properties. The system was studied and characterized in detail, and physics results on LAr scintillation properties are expected soon. ",physics
"  The explosive growth of bandwidth hungry Internet applications has led to the rapid development of new generation mobile network technologies that are expected to provide broadband access to the Internet in a pervasive manner. For example, 6G networks are capable of providing high-speed network access by exploiting higher frequency spectrum; high-throughout satellite communication services are also adopted to achieve pervasive coverage in remote and isolated areas. In order to enable seamless access, Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Communication Networks (ISTCN) has emerged as an important research area. ISTCN aims to provide high speed and pervasive network services by integrating broadband terrestrial mobile networks with satellite communication networks. As terrestrial mobile networks began to use higher frequency spectrum (between 3GHz to 40GHz) which overlaps with that of satellite communication (4GHz to 8GHz for C band and 26GHz to 40GHz for Ka band), there are opportunities and challenges. On one hand, satellite terminals can potentially access terrestrial networks in an integrated manner; on the other hand, there will be more congestion and interference in this spectrum, hence more efficient spectrum management techniques are required. In this paper, we propose a new technique to improve spectrum sharing performance by introducing Non-orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (NOMA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) in the spectrum sharing of ISTCN. In essence, NOMA technology improves spectrum efficiency by allowing different users to transmit on the same carrier and distinguishing users by user power levels while CR technology improves spectrum efficiency through dynamic spectrum sharing. Furthermore, some open researches and challenges in ISTCN will be discussed. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Recent experiments conducted in the International Space Station highlight the apparent periodicity of leaf oscillations and other biological phenomena associated with rhythmic variations of lunisolar forces. These events are similar to those occurring on Earth, but with greater effects over a shorter period of time. Among the possible disturbances, other than forced or self-existing oscillations, parametric resonances appear caused by a small periodic term; such is the case of fluids subjected to small periodic variations in gravitational forces in microscopic or mesoscopic plant channels filled with sap and air-vapor. The interface instabilities verify a Mathieu's second order differential equation resulting from a Rayleigh-Taylor stability model. These instabilities appear during the Moon's rotation around the Earth and during the revolution of the International Space Station. They create impulses of pressure and sap movements in the network of roots, stems and leaves. The model can explain the effects of the lunar tide on plant growth. The eccentricity of the lunar orbit around the Earth creates an important difference between the apogee and perigee of the Moon's trajectory and therefore the tidal effects can depend on the distance between the Moon and the Earth.

As an application of these results, we present an asymptotically tight quantum Faber-Krahn inequality on the hypercube. ",quantum physics

It consists of sending an excited two-level atom through two serial cavities which contain the radiation field. Hence, the Lindblad master equation described the reduced density matrix of the joint-joint field system inside the cavities is exactly solved in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes. However, the rate of entanglement inherent in the total field-field system are evaluated using various witnesses of entanglement such as concurrence, logarithmic negativity and quantum discord. Moreover, the non-classicality by means of negativity volume and Wigner function is discussed. Finally, two schemes of quantum teleportation are suggested. ",quantum physics

"  Deep learning has achieved substantial improvement on single-channel speech enhancement tasks. However, the performance of multi-layer perceptions (MLPs)-based methods is limited by the ability to capture the long-term effective history information. The recurrent neural networks (RNNs), e.g., long short-term memory (LSTM) model, are able to capture the long-term temporal dependencies, but come with the issues of the high latency and the complexity of training.To address these issues, the temporal convolutional network (TCN) was proposed to replace the RNNs in various sequence modeling tasks. In this paper we propose a novel TCN model that employs multi-branch structure, called multi-branch TCN (MB-TCN), for monaural speech enhancement.The MB-TCN exploits split-transform-aggregate design, which is expected to obtain strong representational power at a low computational complexity.Inspired by the TCN, the MB-TCN model incorporates one dimensional causal dilated CNN and residual learning to expand receptive fields for capturing long-term temporal contextual information.Our extensive experimental investigation suggests that the MB-TCNs outperform the residual long short-term memory networks (ResLSTMs), temporal convolutional networks (TCNs), and the CNN networks that employ dense aggregations in terms of speech intelligibility and quality, while providing superior parameter efficiency. Furthermore, our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed MB-TCN model is able to outperform multiple state-of-the-art deep learning-based speech enhancement methods in terms of five widely used objective metrics.

"  We describe a new approach to automated Glaucoma detection in 3D Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) optic nerve scans. First, we gathered a unique and diverse multi-ethnic dataset of OCT scans consisting of glaucoma and non-glaucomatous cases obtained from four tertiary care eye hospitals located in four different countries. Using this longitudinal data, we achieved state-of-the-art results for automatically detecting Glaucoma from a single raw OCT using a 3D Deep Learning system. These results are close to human doctors in a variety of settings across heterogeneous datasets and scanning environments. To verify correctness and interpretability of the automated categorization, we used saliency maps to find areas of focus for the model. Matching human doctor behavior, the model predictions indeed correlated with the conventional diagnostic parameters in the OCT printouts, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer. We further used our model to find new areas in the 3D data that are presently not being identified as a diagnostic parameter to detect glaucoma by human doctors. Namely, we found that the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) region can be a valuable source of helpful diagnostic information previously unavailable to doctors during routine clinical care because it lacks a quantitative printout. Our model provides such volumetric quantification of this region. We found that even when a majority of the RNFL is removed, the LC region can distinguish glaucoma. This is clinically relevant in high myopes, when the RNFL is already reduced, and thus the LC region may help differentiate glaucoma in this confounding situation. We further generalize this approach to create a new algorithm called DiagFind that provides a recipe for finding new diagnostic information in medical imagery that may have been previously unusable by doctors.

"  In this paper, we focus on the sum-rate optimization in a multi-user millimeter-wave (mmWave) system with distributed intelligent reflecting surfaces (D-IRSs), where a base station (BS) communicates with users via multiple IRSs. The BS transmit beamforming, IRS switch vector, and phase shifts of the IRS are jointly optimized to maximize the sum-rate under minimum user rate, unit-modulus, and transmit power constraints. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, the non-convex problem is converted into three subproblems, which are solved alternatively. The solution to transmit beamforming at the BS and the phase shifts at the IRS are derived by using the successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm, and a greedy algorithm is proposed to design the IRS switch vector. The complexity of the proposed AO algorithm is analyzed theoretically. Numerical results show that the D-IRSs-aided scheme can significantly improve the sum-rate and energy efficiency performance.

"  General principles of quantum field theory imply that there exists an operator product expansion (OPE) for Wightman functions in Minkowski momentum space that converges for arbitrary kinematics. This convergence is guaranteed to hold in the sense of a distribution, meaning that it holds for correlation functions smeared by smooth test functions. The conformal blocks for this OPE are conceptually extremely simple: they are products of 3-point functions. We construct the conformal blocks in 2-dimensional conformal field theory and show that the OPE in fact converges pointwise to an ordinary function in a specific kinematic region. Using microcausality, we also formulate a bootstrap equation directly in terms of momentum space Wightman functions. ",high energy physics theory
"  Quantum communication has been leading the way of many remarkable theoretical results and experimental tests in physics. In this context, quantum communication complexity (QCC) has recently drawn earnest research attention as a tool to optimize the amounts of transmitted qubits and energy that are required to implement distributed computational tasks. On this matter, we introduce a novel multi-user quantum fingerprinting protocol that is ready to be implemented with existing technology. Particularly, we extend to the multi-user framework a well-known two-user coherent-state fingerprinting scheme. This generalization is highly non-trivial for a twofold reason, as it requires not only to extend the set of protocol rules but also to specify a procedure for designing the optical devices intended for the generalized protocol. Much of the importance of our work arises from the fact that the obtained QCC figures of merit allow direct comparison with the best-known classical multi-user fingerprinting protocol, of significance in the field of computer technologies and networking. Furthermore, as one of the main contributions of the manuscript, we deduce innovative analytical upper bounds on the amount of transmitted quantum information that are even valid in the two-user protocol as a particular case. Ultimately, comparative results are provided to contrast different protocol implementation strategies and, importantly, to show that, under realistic circumstances, the multi-user protocol can achieve tasks that are impossible by using classical communication alone. Our work provides relevant contributions towards understanding the nature and the limitations of quantum fingerprinting and, on a broader scope, also the limitations and possibilities of quantum-communication networks embracing a node that is accessed by multiple users at the same time.

More recently complex network theory has been applied to quantum systems, where complex network topologies may emerge in multiparty quantum states and quantum algorithms have been studied in complex graph structures. In this work we study multimode Continuous Variables entangled states, named cluster states, where the entanglement structure is arranged in typical real-world complex networks shapes. Cluster states are a resource for measurement-based quantum information protocols, where the quality of a cluster is assessed in term of the minimal amount of noise it introduces in the computation. We study optimal graph states that can be obtained with experimentally realistic quantum resources, when optimized via analytical procedure. We show that denser and regular graphs allow for better optimization. In the spirit of quantum routing we also show the reshaping of entanglement connections in small networks via linear optics operations based on numerical optimization. ",quantum physics
"  A Neptune-sized exomoon candidate was recently announced by Teachey & Kipping, orbiting a 287 day gas giant in the Kepler-1625 system. However, the system is poorly characterized and needs more observations to be confirmed, with the next potential transit in 2019 May. In this Letter, we aid observational follow up by analyzing the transit signature of exomoons. We derive a simple analytic equation for the transit probability and use it to demonstrate how exomoons may frequently avoid transit if their orbit is larger than the stellar radius and sufficiently misaligned. The nominal orbit for the moon in Kepler-1625 has both of these characteristics, and we calculate that it may only transit roughly 40% of the time. This means that approximately six non-transits would be required to rule out the moon's existence at 95% confidence. When an exomoon's impact parameter is displaced off the star, the planet's impact parameter is displaced the other way, so larger planet transit durations are typically positively correlated with missed exomoon transits. On the other hand, strong correlations do not exist between missed exomoon transits and transit timing variations of the planet. We also show that nodal precession does not change an exomoon's transit probability and that it can break a prograde-retrograde degeneracy. ",astrophysics
"  We derive a general exact form of the phase space distribution function and the thermal expectation values of local operators for the free quantum scalar field at equilibrium with rotation and acceleration in flat space-time without solving field equations in curvilinear coordinates. After factorizing the density operator with group theoretical methods, we obtain the exact form of the phase space distribution function as a formal series in thermal vorticity through an iterative method and we calculate thermal expectation values by means of analytic continuation techniques. We separately discuss the cases of pure rotation and pure acceleration and derive analytic results for the stress-energy tensor of the massless field. The expressions found agree with the exact analytic solutions obtained by solving the field equation in suitable curvilinear coordinates for the two cases at stake and already - or implicitly - known in literature. In order to extract finite values for the pure acceleration case we introduce the concept of analytic distillation of a complex function. For the massless field, the obtained expressions of the currents are polynomials in the acceleration/temperature ratios which vanish at $2\pi$, in full accordance with the Unruh effect.

"  Suppose X and Y are binary exposure and outcome variables, and we have full knowledge of the distribution of Y, given application of X. From this we know the average causal effect of X on Y. We are now interested in assessing, for a case that was exposed and exhibited a positive outcome, whether it was the exposure that caused the outcome. The relevant ""probability of causation"", PC, typically is not identified by the distribution of Y given X, but bounds can be placed on it, and these bounds can be improved if we have further information about the causal process. Here we consider cases where we know the probabilistic structure for a sequence of complete mediators between X and Y. We derive a general formula for calculating bounds on PC for any pattern of data on the mediators (including the case with no data). We show that the largest and smallest upper and lower bounds that can result from any complete mediation process can be obtained in processes with at most two steps. We also consider homogeneous processes with many mediators. PC can sometimes be identified as 0 with negative data, but it cannot be identified at 1 even with positive data on an infinite set of mediators. The results have implications for learning about causation from knowledge of general processes and of data on cases. ",mathematics
"  Context. Monte Carlo methods can be used to evaluate the uncertainty of a reaction rate that arises from many uncertain nuclear inputs. However, until now no attempt has been made to find the effect of correlated energy uncertainties in input resonance parameters.   Aims. To investigate the impact of correlated energy uncertainties on reaction rates.   Methods. Using a combination of numerical and Monte Carlo variation of resonance energies, the effect of correlations are investigated. Five reactions are considered: two fictional, illustrative cases and three reactions whose rates are of current interest.   Results. The effect of correlations in resonance energies depends on the specific reaction cross section and temperatures considered. When several resonances contribute equally to a reaction rate, and are located either side of the Gamow peak, correlations between their energies dilute their effect on reaction rate uncertainties. If they are both located above or below the maximum of the Gamow peak, however, correlations between their resonance energies can increase the reaction rate uncertainties. This effect can be hard to predict for complex reactions with wide and narrow resonances contributing to the reaction rate. ",astrophysics
"  While magnetic fields are important in contemporary star formation, their role in primordial star formation is unknown. Magnetic fields of order 10^-16 G are produced by the Biermann battery due to the curved shocks and turbulence associated with the infall of gas into the dark matter minihalos that are the sites of formation of the first stars. These fields are rapidly amplified by a small-scale dynamo until they saturate at or near equipartition with the turbulence in the central region of the gas. Analytic results are given for the outcome of the dynamo, including the effect of compression in the collapsing gas. The mass-to-flux ratio in this gas is 2-3 times the critical value, comparable to that in contemporary star formation. Predictions of the outcomes of simulations using smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and grid-based adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) are given. Because the numerical viscosity and resistivity for the standard resolution of 64 cells per Jeans length are several orders of magnitude greater than the physical values, dynamically significant magnetic fields affect a much smaller fraction of the mass in simulations than in reality.

Another appendix presents a new method of estimating the numerical viscosity; results are given for both SPH and grid-based codes. ",astrophysics

"  CYRA (CrYogenic solar spectrogRAph) is a facility instrument of the 1.6-meter Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). CYRA focuses on the study of the near-infrared solar spectrum between 1 and 5 microns, a under explored region which is not only a fertile ground for photospheric magnetic diagnostics, but also allows a unique window into the chromosphere lying atop the photosphere. CYRA is the first ever fully cryogenic spectrograph in any solar observatory with its two predecessors, on the McMath-Pierce and Mees Telescopes, being based on warm optics except for the detectors and order sorting filters. CYRA is used to probe magnetic fields in various solar features and the quiet photosphere. CYRA measurements will allow new and better 3D extrapolations of the solar magnetic field and will provide more accurate boundary conditions for solar activity models. Superior spectral resolution of 150,000 and better allows enhanced observations of the chromosphere in the carbon monoxide (CO) spectral bands and will yield a better understanding of energy transport in the solar atmosphere.

"  Overshooting from the convective cores of stars more massive than about 1.2 M(Sun) has a profound impact on their subsequent evolution. And yet, the formulation of the overshooting mechanism in current stellar evolution models has a free parameter (f[ov] in the diffusive approximation) that remains poorly constrained by observations, affecting the determination of astrophysically important quantities such as stellar ages. In an earlier series of papers we assembled a sample of 37 well-measured detached eclipsing binaries to calibrate the dependence of f[ov] on stellar mass, showing that it increases sharply up to a mass of roughly 2 M(Sun), and remains constant thereafter out to at least 4.4 M(Sun). Recent claims have challenged the utility of eclipsing binaries for this purpose, on the basis that the uncertainties in f[ov] from the model fits are typically too large to be useful, casting doubt on a dependence of overshooting on mass. Here we reexamine those claims and show them to be too pessimistic, mainly because they did not account for all available constraints --- both observational and theoretical --- in assessing the true uncertainties. We also take the opportunity to add semi-empirical f[ov] determinations for 13 additional binaries to our previous sample, and to update the values for 9 others. All are consistent with, and strengthen our previous conclusions, supporting a dependence of f[ov] on mass that is now based on estimates for a total of 50 binary systems (100 stars). ",astrophysics
"  In this paper we apply a methodology, recently proposed by Bourouaine and Perez (2019) (BP19), to interpret solar-wind turbulent power spectra beyond Taylor approximation (TA). The turbulent power spectra were measured using \emph{Helios} spacecraft data near 0.6 au. We use the model proposed in BP19 to reproduce the field-perpendicular power spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ of anti-sunward Alfv\'enic fluctuations in the plasma frame (where $k_\perp$ is the field-perpendicular wavenumber) from the corresponding measured frequency power spectrum $P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ along the sampling angle $\theta_b$, which is the angle between the local magnetic field and the sampling direction. Here $\omega=2\pi f$ and $f$ is the frequency of the time signal. Interestingly enough, we found that for all corresponding measured frequency power spectrum $P_{\rm sc}(\omega,\theta_b)$ the reproduced field-perpendicular power spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ is the same and independent of the considered sampling angle $\theta_b$. This finding is consistent with the fact that the analyzed turbulence is strong and highly anisotropic with $k_\| \ll k_\perp$ (where $k_\|$ is the field-parallel wavenumber). Furthermore, for this specific time signal we found that the commonly used TA is still approximately valid with the important difference that a broadening in $k_\perp$ for each angular frequency $\omega$ is present. This broadening can be described in the context of the methodology proposed in BP19. ",astrophysics

"  The role of massive stars is central to an understanding of galactic ecology. It is important to establish the details of how massive stars provide radiative, chemical, and mechanical feedback in galaxies. Central to these issues is an understanding of the evolution of massive stars, and the critical role of mass loss via strongly structured winds and stellar binarity. Ultimately, massive stellar clusters shape the structure and energetics of galaxies. We aim to conduct high-resolution, deep field mapping at 21cm of the core of the massive Cygnus OB2 association and to characterise the properties of the massive stars and colliding winds at this waveband. We used seven stations of the e-MERLIN radio facility, with its upgraded bandwidth and enhanced sensitivity to conduct a 21cm census of Cygnus OB2. Based on 42 hours of observations, seven overlapping pointings were employed over multiple epochs during 2014 resulting in 1 sigma sensitivities down to ~21microJy and a resolution of ~180mas.

"  We continue our investigation into the nonlinear evolution of the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability in differentially rotating radiation zones. This instability may be a key player in transporting angular momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains mostly unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability, whereas here we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq model in a modified shearing box for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations with stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear instability and derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear evolution. The instability is found to behave very differently compared with its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the development of strong zonal jets (""layering"" in the angular momentum), which can considerably enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations. The jets are, in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle that corresponds initially with that of the linear modes, but which evolves with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability transports angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it does at the equator, and we estimate that the GSF instability could contribute to the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the long-term evolution of the solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters. ",astrophysics

"  In this paper we use the gauge/gravity duality to perform the first systematic study of the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a hot and dense far-from-equilibrium strongly coupled relativistic fluid with a critical point. By employing a top-down holographic construction that stems from string theory, we numerically obtain the full nonlinear evolution of the far-from-equilibrium system undergoing a Bjorken expansion and address the following question: how does hydrodynamic behavior emerge in the vicinity of a critical point in the phase diagram? For the top-down holographic system analyzed in the present work, we find that the approach to hydrodynamics is strongly affected by the presence of the critical point: the closer the ratio between the chemical potential and the temperature is to its critical value, the longer it takes for the system to be well described by the equations of viscous hydrodynamics.

Here we demonstrate a new device, an \textit{optical lock-in camera}, and highlight how they can be used within a gravitational wave interferometer to directly image fields at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than previously possible. This improvement is achieved using a Pockels cell as a fast optical switch which transforms each pixel on a sCMOS array into an optical lock-in amplifier. We demonstrate that the optical lock-in camera can image fields with 2~Mpx resolution at 10~Hz with a sensitivity of -62~dBc when averaged over 2s. ",astrophysics
"  Parker Solar Probe (PSP) routinely observes magnetic field deflections in the solar wind at distances less than 0.3 au from the Sun. These deflections are related to structures commonly called 'switchbacks' (SBs), whose origins and characteristic properties are currently debated. Here, we use a database of visually selected SB intervals - and regions of solar wind plasma measured just before and after each SB - to examine plasma parameters, turbulent spectra from inertial to dissipation scales, and intermittency effects in these intervals. We find that many features, such as perpendicular stochastic heating rates and turbulence spectral slopes are fairly similar inside and outside of SBs. However, important kinetic properties, such as the characteristic break scale between the inertial to dissipation ranges differ inside and outside these intervals, as does the level of intermittency, which is notably enhanced inside SBs and in their close proximity, most likely due to magnetic field and velocity shears observed at the edges. We conclude that the plasma inside and outside of a SB, in most of the observed cases, belongs to the same stream, and that the evolution of these structures is most likely regulated by kinetic processes, which dominate small scale structures at the SB edges.

"  In this paper, we study extended linear regression approaches for quantum state tomography based on regularization techniques. For unknown quantum states represented by density matrices, performing measurements under certain basis yields random outcomes, from which a classical linear regression model can be established. First of all, for complete or over-complete measurement bases, we show that the empirical data can be utilized for the construction of a weighted least squares estimate (LSE) for quantum tomography. Taking into consideration the trace-one condition, a constrained weighted LSE can be explicitly computed, being the optimal unbiased estimation among all linear estimators. Next, for general measurement bases, we show that $\ell_2$-regularization with proper regularization gain provides even lower mean-square error under a cost in bias. The regularization parameter is tuned by two estimators in terms of a risk characterization. Finally, a concise and unified formula is established for the regularization parameter with complete measurement basis under an equivalent regression model, which proves that the proposed tuning estimators are asymptotically optimal as the number of samples grows to infinity under the risk metric. Additionally, numerical examples are provided to validate the established results. ",quantum physics
  We introduce High-Relative Degree Stochastic Control Lyapunov functions and Barrier Functions as a means to ensure asymptotic stability of the system and incorporate state dependent high relative degree safety constraints on a non-linear stochastic systems. Our proposed formulation also provides a generalisation to the existing literature on control Lyapunov and barrier functions for stochastic systems. The control policies are evaluated using a constrained quadratic program that is based on control Lyapunov and barrier functions. Our proposed control design is validated via simulated experiments on a relative degree 2 system (2 dimensional car navigation) and relative degree 4 system (two-link pendulum with elastic actuator). ,electrical engineering and systems science
"  We discuss the dRGT massive gravity interacting with spin-0, spin-1/2, or spin-1 matter. The effective theory of a massive spin-2 particle coupled to matter particles is constructed directly at the amplitude level. In this setting we calculate the gravitational Compton scattering amplitudes and study their UV properties. While the Compton amplitudes generically grow with energy as $\mathcal{O}(E^6)$, we identify regions of the parameter space where they are softened to $\mathcal{O}(E^4)$ or even $\mathcal{O}(E^3)$, which allows for a larger validity range of the effective theory. In these regions, both positivity and beyond-positivity of the forward Compton amplitudes are fulfilled, and the equivalence principle automatically emerges. ",high energy physics theory
"  We determine analytically the energy gap at weak coupling in the attractive multi-component Gaudin--Yang model, an integrable model which describes interacting fermions in one dimension with $\kappa$ components. We use three different methods. The first one is based on a direct analysis of the Bethe ansatz equations. The second method uses the theory of resurgence and the large order behavior of the perturbative series for the ground state energy. The third method is based on a renormalization group analysis. The three methods lead to the same answer, providing in this way a non-trivial test of the ideas of resurgence and renormalons as applied to non-relativistic many-body systems.

"  We compute the superconformal characters of various short multiplets in 4d N=2 superconformal algebra, from which selection rules for operator products are obtained. Combining with the superconformal index, we show that a particular short multiplet appearing in the n-fold product of stress-tensor multiplet is absent in the $(A_1, A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas (AD) theory. This implies that the operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients involving this multiplet vanish whenever the central charge $c$ is identical to that of the AD theory. Similarly, by considering the n-th power of the current multiplet, we show that a particular short multiplet and OPE coefficients vanish for a class of AD theories with ADE flavor symmetry. We also consider the generalized AD theory of type $(A_{k-1}, A_{n-1})$ for coprime k, n and compute its Macdonald index using the associated W-algebra under a mild assumption. This allows us to show that a number of short multiplets and OPE coefficients vanish in this theory. We also provide a Mathematica file along with this paper, where we implement the algorithm by Cordova-Dumitrescu-Intriligator to compute the spectrum of 4d N=2 superconformal multiplets as well as their superconformal character.

"  We show that all self-adjoint extensions of semi-bounded Sturm--Liouville operators with general limit-circle endpoint(s) can be obtained via an additive singular form bounded self-adjoint perturbation of rank equal to the deficiency indices, say $d\in\{1,2\}$. This characterization generalizes the well-known analog for semi-bounded Sturm--Liouville operators with regular endpoints. Explicitly, every self-adjoint extension of the minimal operator can be written as \begin{align*}   \boldsymbol{A}_\Theta=\boldsymbol{A}_0+{\bf B}\Theta{\bf B}^*, \end{align*} where $\boldsymbol{A}_0$ is a distinguished self-adjoint extension and $\Theta$ is a self-adjoint linear relation in $\mathbb{C}^d$. The perturbation is singular in the sense that it does not belong to the underlying Hilbert space but is form bounded with respect to $\boldsymbol{A}_0$, i.e. it belongs to $\mathcal{H}_{-1}(\boldsymbol{A}_0)$. The construction of a boundary triple and compatible boundary pair for the symmetric operator ensure that the perturbation is well-defined and self-adjoint extensions are in a one-to-one correspondence with self-adjoint relations $\Theta$.   As an example, self-adjoint extensions of the classical symmetric Jacobi differential equation (which has two limit-circle endpoints) are obtained and their spectra are analyzed with tools both from the theory of boundary triples and perturbation theory.

"  Generative models in deep learning allow for sampling probability distributions that approximate data distributions. We propose using generative models for making approximate statistical predictions in the string theory landscape. For vacua admitting a Lagrangian description this can be thought of as learning random tensor approximations of couplings. As a concrete proof-of-principle, we demonstrate in a large ensemble of Calabi-Yau manifolds that Kahler metrics evaluated at points in Kahler moduli space are well-approximated by ensembles of matrices produced by a deep convolutional Wasserstein GAN. Accurate approximations of the Kahler metric eigenspectra are achieved with far fewer than $h^{11}$ Gaussian draws. Accurate extrapolation to values of $h^{11}$ outside the training set are achieved via a conditional GAN. Together, these results implicitly suggest the existence of strong correlations in the data, as might be expected if Reid's fantasy is correct. ",high energy physics theory
"  Linear and nonlinear modelling of Alfv\'enic instabilities, most notably toroidal Alfv\'en eigenmodes (TAEs), obtained by using the global nonlinear electromagnetic gyrokinetic model of the code ORB5 are presented for the 15 MA scenario of the ITER tokamak.

Low mode number TAEs are found to be global, requiring global treatment. Nonlinearly, even with double the nominal EP density, single mode simulations lead to saturation with negligible EP transport however multi-mode simulations predict that with double the nominal EP density, enhanced saturation and significant EP redistribution will occur.

"  The Neutron Transport Equation (NTE) describes the flux of neutrons over time through an inhomogeneous fissile medium. In the recent articles [5, 10], a probabilistic solution of the NTE is considered in order to demonstrate a Perron-Frobenius type growth of the solution via its projection onto an associated leading eigenfunction. In [9, 4], further analysis is performed to understand the implications of this growth both in the stochastic sense, as well as from the perspective of Monte-Carlo simulation. Such Monte-Carlo simulations are prevalent in industrial applications, in particular where regulatory checks are needed in the process of reactor core design. In that setting, however, it turns out that a different notion of growth takes centre stage, which is otherwise characterised by another eigenvalue problem. In that setting, the eigenvalue, sometimes called k-effective (written $k_\texttt{eff}$), has the physical interpretation as being the ratio of neutrons produced (during fission events) to the number lost (due to absorption in the reactor or leakage at the boundary) per typical fission event. In this article, we aim to supplement [5, 10, 9, 4], by developing the stochastic analysis of the NTE further to the setting where a rigorous probabilistic interpretation of keff is given, both in terms of a Perron-Frobenius type analysis as well as via classical operator analysis. To our knowledge, despite the fact that an extensive engineering literature and industrial Monte-Carlo software is concentrated around the estimation of keff and its associated eigenfunction, we believe that our work is the first rigorous treatment in the probabilistic sense (which underpins some of the aforesaid Monte-Carlo simulations).

  We develop the idea of local duality symmetry (LDS) in gauge field theories. Using Clifford algebra techniques we construct dually invariant scalar Lagrangian of electrodynamics in the presence of sources and demonstrate that in tensor formalism it is exactly the same as the usual one. Then we localize the duality symmetry with two possible options for the appearing pseudovector field - massive and massless. The first option might be interpreted as a candidate for dark matter. Perspectives of the application of LDS in QCD are briefly discussed. ,high energy physics theory

We formulate constraints in 6D spinor helicity formalism and find all generators of the 6D dual superconformal algebra. Next we check that they agree with the dual superconformal generators of known 3D and 4D theories.

The black hole evolutions refer to the instability due to the Parikh-Kraus-Wilczeck tunneling radiation or fragmentation. It is found that the EUP corrections make the entropy difference larger to encourage the black hole to radiate more greatly. We also show that the appearance of the EUP effects result in the black hole's division. The influence from global monopole and the revision of general relativity can also adjust the black hole evolution simultaneously, but can not change the final result that the black hole will not be stable because of the EUP's effects.

"  Available algorithms for the initialization of volume fractions typically utilize exact functions to model fluid interfaces, or they rely on computationally costly intersections between volume meshes. Here, a new algorithm is proposed that computes signed distances and volume fractions on unstructured meshes from arbitrarily shaped surfaces, e.g. originating from experimental data. The proposed algorithm calculates signed distances geometrically near the fluid interface, approximated as a triangle surface mesh, and propagates the inside/outside information by an approximate solution of a Laplace equation. Volume fractions are computed based on signed distances, using either geometrical intersections between cells of the unstructured mesh and a sub-set of the surface mesh that represents the interface, or using a polynomial approximation and adaptive mesh refinement. Although primarily developed for multiphase flow simulations, the proposed algorithm can potentially be used for other problems that require a phase-indicator: inside/outside information with respect to an arbitrarily shaped surface on arbitrarily unstructured meshes.

"  It was recently discovered that for a boundary system in the presence of a background magnetic field, the quantum fluctuation of the vacuum would create a non-uniform magnetization density for the vacuum and a magnetization current is induced in the vacuum. It was also shown that this ""magnetic Casimir effect"" of the vacuum is closely related to another quantum effect of the vacuum, the Weyl anomaly. Furthermore, the phenomena can be understood in terms of the holography of the boundary system. In this paper, we generalize this four dimensional effect to six dimensions. We use the AdS/BCFT holography to show that in the presence of a 3-form magnetic field strength $H$,a string current is induced in a six dimensional boundary conformal field theory. This allows us to determine the gauge field contribution to the Weyl anomaly in six dimensional conformal field theory in a $H$-flux background. For the (2,0) superconformal field theory of $N$ M5-branes, the current has a magnitude proportional to $N^3$ for large $N$. This suggests that the degree of freedoms scales as $N^3$ in the (2,0) superconformal theory of $N$ multiple M5-branes. The prediction we have for the Weyl anomaly is a new criteria that the (2,0) theory should satisfy. ",high energy physics theory
"  NGC 6822 is the closest isolated dwarf irregular galaxy to the Milky Way. Its proximity and stellar mass ($10^8 M_\odot$, large for a dwarf galaxy) allow for a detailed study of its kinematic properties. The red giant branch (RGB) stars at the galaxy's center are particularly interesting because they are aligned on an axis perpendicular to the galaxy's more extended HI disk. We detected a velocity gradient among the RGB population using spectra from Keck DEIMOS. This rotation is aligned with the HI disk, but the sense of rotation is about the major axis of the central RGB population. We measured the rotation velocity ($v$) and velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the RGB population in five metallicity bins. We found an increase of rotation support ($v/\sigma$) with increasing metallicity, driven primarily by decreasing dispersion. We also deduced an increasing radial distance for lower metallicity stars at $-0.5$~kpc/dex by relating the observed stellar kinematics to position via NGC 6822's HI velocity curve. While the inverted metallicity gradient-like could be interpreted as evidence for an outside-in formation scenario, it may instead indicate that stellar feedback disturbed a centrally star forming galaxy over time.

"  A novel mathematical framework is derived for the addition of nodes to univariate and interpolatory quadrature rules. The framework is based on the geometrical interpretation of the Vandermonde matrix describing the relation between the nodes and the weights and can be used to determine all nodes that can be added to an interpolatory quadrature rule with positive weights such that the positive weights are preserved. In the case of addition of a single node, the derived inequalities that describe the regions where nodes can be added are explicit. Besides addition of nodes these inequalities also yield an algorithmic description of the replacement and removal of nodes. It is shown that it is not always possible to add a single node while preserving positive weights. On the other hand, addition of multiple nodes and preservation of positive weights is always possible, although the minimum number of nodes that need to be added can be as large as the number of nodes of the quadrature rule. In case of addition of multiple nodes the inequalities describing the regions where nodes can be added become implicit. It is shown that the well-known Patterson extension of quadrature rules is a special case that forms the boundary of these regions and various examples of the applicability of the framework are discussed. By exploiting the framework, two new sets of quadrature rules are proposed. Their performance is compared with the well-known Gaussian and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules, demonstrating the advantages of our proposed nested quadrature rules with positive weights and fine granularity.

"  As more people move back into densely populated cities, bike sharing is emerging as an important mode of urban mobility. In a typical bike sharing system, riders arrive at a station and take a bike if it is available. After retrieving a bike, they ride it for a while, then return it to a station near their final destinations. Since space is limited in cities, each station has a finite capacity of docks, which cannot hold more bikes than its capacity. In this paper, we study bike sharing systems with stations having a finite capacity. By an appropriate scaling of our stochastic model, we prove a central limit theorem for an empirical process of the number of stations with $k$ bikes. The central limit theorem provides insight on the variance, and sample path dynamics of large scale bike sharing systems. We also leverage our results to estimate confidence intervals for various performance measures such as the proportion of empty stations, the proportion of full stations, and the number of bikes in circulation. These performance measures have the potential to inform the operations and design of future bike sharing systems. ",mathematics

"  Flagella of eukaryotic cells are transient long cylindrical protrusions. The proteins needed to form and maintain flagella are synthesized in the cell body and transported to the distal tips. What `rulers' or `timers' a specific type of cells use to strike a balance between the outward and inward transport of materials so as to maintain a particular length of its flagella in the steady state is one of the open questions in cellular self-organization. Even more curious is how the two flagella of biflagellates, like Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii, communicate through their base to coordinate their lengths. In this paper we develop a stochastic model for flagellar length control based on a time-of-flight (ToF) mechanism. This ToF mechanism decides whether or not structural proteins are to be loaded onto an intraflagellar transport (IFT) train just before it begins its motorized journey from the base to the tip of the flagellum. Because of the ongoing turnover, the structural proteins released from the flagellar tip are transported back to the cell body also by IFT trains. We represent the traffic of IFT trains as a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). The ToF mechanism for each flagellum, together with the TASEP-based description of the IFT trains, combined with a scenario of sharing of a common pool of flagellar structural proteins in biflagellates, can account for all key features of experimentally known phenomena. These include ciliogenesis, resorption, deflagellation as well as regeneration after selective amputation of one of the two flagella. We also show that the experimental observations of Ishikawa and Marshall are consistent with the ToF mechanism of length control if the effects of the mutual exclusion of the IFT trains captured by the TASEP are taken into account. Moreover, we make new predictions on the flagellar length fluctuations and the role of the common pool. ",physics
"  Calcein leakage assays are a standard experimental set-up for probing the extent of damage induced by external agents on synthetic lipid vesicles. The fluorescence signal associated with calcein release from liposomes is the signature of vesicle disruption, transient pore formation or vesicle fusion. This type of assay is widely used to test the membrane disruptive effect of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, antimicrobial peptides and RNA and is also used on synthetic nanoparticles with a polymer, metal or oxide core. Little is known about the effect that calcein and other fluorescent dyes may have on the properties of lipid bilayers, potentially altering their structure and permeability. Here we develop a coarse-grained model of calcein that is compatible with the Martini force field for lipids. We validate the model by comparing its dimerization free energy, aggregation behavior at different concentrations and interaction with a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane to those obtained at atomistic resolution. Our coarse-grained description of calcein makes it suitable for the simulation of large calcein-filled liposomes and of their interactions with external agents, allowing for a direct comparison between simulations and experimental liposome leakage assays.

"  The highly resolved temporal evolution of laser-induced micro-explosions on a germanium surface is studied in a triode configuration for various gate charge levels and cathode currents. Electron emission from individual spots is directly imaged with a luminescence screen, showing that the opening angle of the source is about 30$^\circ$. Electron bunches of several nanocoulombs per pulse in a time interval of about 150 ns are directly extracted to the anode without vacuum breakdown in the cathodic gap. When breakdown occurs, a remarkable change in the arc behavior of a threshold gap potential of around 1 kV is observed, which hints at two different evaporation mechanisms that depend on the cathodic fall of an individual spot. Therefore, for voltages well above the threshold, a fast gate discharge is observed within the first 100-200 ns, followed by fundamental plasma oscillations and an electron emission of several $\mu$C per pulse from the plasma boundary. Additionally, highly efficient emission of germanium ion clusters occurs, evidencing a stable two-fold electron multiplication in the plasma, with a charge of several $\mu$C per pulse below the threshold.

"  We present the development and benchmarking of an in-house fluid-structure interaction (FSI) solver. An implicit partitioned approach is utilized to couple a sharp-interface immersed boundary (IB) method based flow solver and a finite-element method based structural solver. In the present work, the coupling is accelerated using a dynamic under-relaxation scheme. The revised coupling is around two to three times faster and numerically stable, as compared to the one that uses a constant under-relaxation parameter. The solver is validated against two FSI benchmarks in which a thin, finite thickness, elastic splitter plate is attached to the lee side of a circular or square rigid cylinder, subjected to laminar flow. In these two-dimensional benchmarks, the flow induces a wave-like deformation in the plate, and it attains a periodic self-sustained oscillation. We employ the FSI solver to analyze the flow-induced vibration (FIV) of the plate in a uniform laminar free-stream flow for a wide range of mass ratio and bending stiffness at Reynolds number ($Re$) of 100, based on the diameter of the cylinder. At the given $Re$, two-dimensional numerical simulations show that the FIV of the plate effectively depends only on the mass ratio and bending stiffness. The largest displacement of the plate vibration is found to occur in the lock-in region, where the vortex shedding frequency of the coupled fluid-structure system is close to the natural frequency of the splitter plate. We briefly discuss wake structures and phase plots for different cases of mass ratio and bending stiffness. ",physics
"  We propose a nonparametric test of independence, termed optHSIC, between a covariate and a right-censored lifetime. Because the presence of censoring creates a challenge in applying the standard permutation-based testing approaches, we use optimal transport to transform the censored dataset into an uncensored one, while preserving the relevant dependencies. We then apply a permutation test using the kernel-based dependence measure as a statistic to the transformed dataset. The type 1 error is proven to be correct in the case where censoring is independent of the covariate. Experiments indicate that optHSIC has power against a much wider class of alternatives than Cox proportional hazards regression and that it has the correct type 1 control even in the challenging cases where censoring strongly depends on the covariate.

"  We consider the holographic duality between 4d type-A higher-spin gravity and a 3d free vector model. It is known that the Feynman diagrams for boundary correlators can be encapsulated in an HS-algebraic twistorial expression. This expression can be evaluated not just on separate boundary insertions, but on entire finite source distributions. We do so for the first time, and find that the result Z_HS disagrees with the usual CFT partition function. While such disagreement was expected due to contact corrections, it persists even in their absence. We ascribe it to a confusion between on-shell and off-shell boundary calculations. In Lorentzian boundary signature, this manifests via wrong relative signs for Feynman diagrams with different permutations of the source points. In Euclidean, the signs are instead ambiguous, spoiling would-be linear superpositions. Framing the situation as a conflict between boundary locality and HS symmetry, we sacrifice locality and choose to take Z_HS seriously. We are rewarded by the dissolution of a long-standing pathology in higher-spin dS/CFT. Though we lose the connection to the local CFT, the precise form of Z_HS can be recovered from first principles, by demanding a spin-local boundary action. ",high energy physics theory
"  Flow past a high-lift low-pressure turbine (LPT) blade in a cascade could be quite complex as phenomena like separation and transition are often involved. For a highly loadedT106A blade at a high incidence and relatively low Reynolds number(25, 000 < Re < 1, 00, 000), separation-induced transition is observed on the suction side of the blade, making it a challenging problem for model-based simulations. In this work, computations for this flow are carried out using RANS and hybrid LES/RANS approaches. The RANS simulations are performed with six popular low- Re turbulence models. While turbulence models by themselves fail to predict any separation on the T106A blade, the four-equation Langtry-Menter transition model predicts a short separation bubble. The characteristic of this bubble, however, is very different from what is observed in experiments and DNS, and therefore transition is not accurately predicted. An embedded hybrid LES/RANS approach, Limited numerical scales(LNS), with an automatic switch to LES in sufficiently resolved grids, is then used for predictions on the sameRANS grid. With the statistical turbulence on fine grids, LES-like behavior of LNS results in an unphysical drop in Reynolds stresses as the turbulent fluctuations are not appropriately represented on the resolved scale. Therefore, the LNS results are very similar to those obtained with turbulence models.

"  This paper is concerned with an inverse random source problem for the one-dimensional stochastic Helmholtz equation with attenuation. The source is assumed to be a microlocally isotropic Gaussian random field with its covariance operator being a classical pseudo-differential operator. The random sources under consideration are equivalent to the generalized fractional Gaussian random fields which include rough fields and can be even rougher than the white noise, and hence should be interpreted as distributions. The well-posedness of the direct source scattering problem is established in the distribution sense. The micro-correlation strength of the random source, which appears to be the strength in the principal symbol of the covariance operator, is proved to be uniquely determined by the wave field in an open measurement set. Numerical experiments are presented for the white noise model to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. ",mathematics
"  We demonstrate the feasibility of coincidence measurements in a conventional transmission electron microscope, revealing the temporal correlation between electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy events. We make use of a delay line detector with picosecond time resolution attached to a modified EELS spectrometer. We demonstrate that coincidence between both events, related to the excitation and de-excitation of atoms in a crystal, provides added information not present in the individual EELS or EDX spectra. In particular, the method provides EELS with a significantly suppressed or even removed background, overcoming the many difficulties with conventional parametric background fitting as it uses no assumptions on the shape of the background, requires no user input and does not suffer from counting noise originating from the background signal. This is highly attractive, especially when low concentrations of elements need to be detected in a matrix of other elements. ",physics
"  We propose various new 3d N=2 dualities exploiting their recently discovered connection to the duality relations for 2d free field CFT correlators. Most of the dualities involve, as the main building block, a quiver theory with monopole superpotential which enjoys various interesting properties such as being self-dual and reducing, in a suitable real mass deformation, to the familiar T[SU(N)] theory. In particular we propose a duality for the U(N) theory with one adjoint and k+1 fundamental flavors. By iterating some basic dualities we can bring the theory to a stable form which, in turns, allows us to find a dual frame where the rank of the original theory appears as a parameter.

"  Direct Statistical Simulation (DSS) solves the equations of motion for the statistics of turbulent flows in place of the traditional route of accumulating statistics by Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). That low-order statistics usually evolve slowly compared with instantaneous dynamics is one important advantage of DSS. Depending on the symmetry of the problem and the choice of averaging operation, however, DSS is usually more expensive computationally than DNS because even low order statistics typically have higher dimension than the underlying fields. Here we show that it is possible to go much further by using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) to address the ""curse of dimensionality."" We apply POD directly to DSS in the form of expansions in the equal-time cumulants to second order (CE2). We explore two averaging operations (zonal and ensemble) and test the approach on two idealized barotropic models on a rotating sphere (a jet that relaxes deterministically towards an unstable profile, and a stochastically-driven flow that spontaneously organizes into jets). Order-of-magnitude savings in computational cost are obtained in the reduced basis, potentially enabling access to parameter regimes beyond the reach of DNS. ",physics
"  Inspired by ER=EPR conjecture we present a mathematical tool providing a link between quantum entanglement and the geometry of spacetime. We start with the idea of operators in extended Hilbert space which, by definition, has no positive definite scalar product. Adopting several simple postulates we show that a quantum harmonic oscillator can be constructed as a positive definite sector in that space. We discuss the two-dimensional oscillator constructed in such a way that the ground state is maximally entangled. Being a vector in the Hilbert space, it has also a non-trivial expansion in a bigger extended space. On one hand, the space is not free of negative norm states. On the other hand, it allows one to interpret the ground state geometrically in terms of $AdS_3$. The interpretation is based solely on the form of the expansion, revealing certain structures at the boundary and in the bulk of $AdS_3$. The former correspond to world lines of massless particles at the boundary. The latter resemble interacting closed strings. ",high energy physics theory
"  Fluorescence-detected Fourier transform (FT) spectroscopy is a technique in which the relative paths of an optical interferometer are controlled to excite a material sample, and the ensuing fluorescence is detected as a function of the interferometer path delay and relative phase. A common approach to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio in these experiments is to apply a continuous phase sweep to the relative optical path, and to detect the resulting modulated fluorescence using a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. In many important situations, the fluorescence signal is too weak to be measured using a lock-in amplifier, so that photon counting techniques are preferred. Here we introduce an approach to low-signal fluorescence-detected FT spectroscopy, in which individual photon counts are assigned to a modulated interferometer phase ('phase-tagged photon counting,' or PTPC), and the resulting data are processed to construct optical spectra. We studied the fluorescence signals of a molecular sample excited resonantly by a pulsed coherent laser over a range of photon flux and visibility levels. We compare the performance of PTPC to standard lock-in detection methods and establish the range of signal parameters over which meaningful measurements can be carried out. We find that PTPC generally outperforms the lock-in detection method, with the dominant source of measurement uncertainty being associated with the statistics of the finite number of samples of the photon detection rate.

"  A diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm is introduced that can determine the correct nodal structure of the wave function of a few-fermion system and its ground-state energy without an uncontrolled bias. This is achieved by confining signed random walkers to the points of a uniform infinite spatial grid, allowing them to meet and annihilate one another to establish the nodal structure without the fixed-node approximation. An imaginary-time propagator is derived rigorously from a discretized Hamiltonian, governing a non-Gaussian, sign-flipping, branching, and mutually annihilating random walk of particles. The accuracy of the resulting stochastic representations of a fermion wave function is limited only by the grid and imaginary-time resolutions and can be improved in a controlled manner. The method is tested for a series of model problems including fermions in a harmonic trap as well as the He atom in its singlet or triplet ground state. For the latter case, the energies approach from above with increasing grid resolution and converge within $0.015~{E}_\text{h}$ of the exact basis-set-limit value with a statistical uncertainty of $10^{-5}~{E}_\text{h}$ without an importance sampling or Jastrow factor.

"  We consider a non-relativistic limit of the bosonic sector of eleven-dimensional supergravity, leading to a theory based on a covariant `membrane Newton-Cartan' (MNC) geometry. The local tangent space is split into three `longitudinal' and eight `transverse' directions, related only by Galilean rather than Lorentzian symmetries. This generalises the ten-dimensional stringy Newton-Cartan (SNC) theory. In order to obtain a finite limit, the field strength of the eleven-dimensional four-form is required to obey a transverse self-duality constraint, ultimately due to the presence of the Chern-Simons term in eleven dimensions. The finite action then gives a set of equations that is invariant under longitudinal and transverse rotations, Galilean boosts and local dilatations. We supplement these equations with an extra Poisson equation, coming from the subleading action. Reduction along a longitudinal direction gives the known SNC theory with the addition of RR gauge fields, while reducing along a transverse direction yields a new non-relativistic theory associated to D2 branes. We further show that the MNC theory can be embedded in the U-duality symmetric formulation of exceptional field theory, demonstrating that it shares the same exceptional Lie algebraic symmetries as the relativistic supergravity, and providing an alternative derivation of the extra Poisson equation.

"  We consider two-stage robust optimization problems, which can be seen as games between a decision maker and an adversary. After the decision maker fixes part of the solution, the adversary chooses a scenario from a specified uncertainty set. Afterwards, the decision maker can react to this scenario by completing the partial first-stage solution to a full solution.   We extend this classic setting by adding another adversary stage after the second decision-maker stage, which results in min-max-min-max problems, thus pushing two-stage settings further towards more general multi-stage problems. We focus on budgeted uncertainty sets and consider both the continuous and discrete case. For the former, we show that a wide range of robust combinatorial optimization problems can be decomposed into polynomially many subproblems, which can be solved in polynomial time for example in the case of (representative) selection. For the latter, we prove NP-hardness for a wide range of problems, but note that the special case where first- and second-stage adversarial costs are equal can remain solvable in polynomial time.

"  Neutral-beam-driven, sub-cyclotron compressional (CAE) and global (GAE) \Alfven eigenmodes are routinely excited in spherical tokamaks such as NSTX(-U) and MAST, have been observed on the conventional aspect ratio tokamak DIII-D, and may be unstable in ITER burning plasmas. Their presence has been experimentally linked to the anomalous flattening of electron temperature profiles at high beam power in NSTX, potentially limiting fusion performance. A detailed understanding of CAE/GAE excitation, therefore, is vital to predicting (and ultimately controlling) their effects on plasma confinement. To this end, hybrid kinetic-MHD simulations are complemented with an analytic study of the linear stability properties of CAEs and GAEs. Perturbative, local analytic theory has been used to derive new instability conditions for CAEs/GAEs driven by realistic neutral beam distributions. A comprehensive set of simulations of NSTX-like plasmas has been performed for a wide range of beam parameters, providing a wealth of information on CAE and GAE stability in spherical tokamaks. Linear simulations show that the excitation of CAEs vs GAEs has a complex dependence on the fast ion injection velocity and geometry, qualitatively described by the analytic theory developed in this thesis. Strong energetic particle modifications of GAEs are found in simulations, indicating the existence of a new type of high frequency energetic particle mode. A cross validation between the theoretical stability bounds, simulation results, and experimental measurements shows favorable agreement for both the unstable CAE and GAE spectra's dependence on fast ion parameters. The analytic results accurately explain the recent experimental discovery of GAE stabilization with small amounts of off-axis beam injection on NSTX-U and suggest new techniques for control of these instabilities in future experiments.

"  This paper gives a definitive solution to the problem of describing conjugacy classes in arbitrary Coxeter groups in terms of cyclic shifts.   Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. A cyclic shift of an element $w\in W$ is a conjugate of $w$ of the form $sws$ for some simple reflection $s\in S$ such that $\ell_S(sws)\leq\ell_S(w)$. The cyclic shift class of $w$ is then the set of elements of $W$ that can be obtained from $w$ by a sequence of cyclic shifts. Given a subset $K\subseteq S$ such that $W_K:=\langle K\rangle\subseteq W$ is finite, we also call two elements $w,w'\in W$ $K$-conjugate if $w,w'$ normalise $W_K$ and $w'=w_0(K)ww_0(K)$, where $w_0(K)$ is the longest element of $W_K$.   Let $\mathcal O$ be a conjugacy class in $W$, and let $\mathcal O^{\min}$ be the set of elements of minimal length in $\mathcal O$. Then $\mathcal O^{\min}$ is the disjoint union of finitely many cyclic shift classes $C_1,\dots,C_k$. We define the structural conjugation graph associated to $\mathcal O$ to be the graph with vertices $C_1,\dots,C_k$, and with an edge between distinct vertices $C_i,C_j$ if they contain representatives $u\in C_i$ and $v\in C_j$ such that $u,v$ are $K$-conjugate for some $K\subseteq S$.   In this paper, we compute explicitely the structural conjugation graph associated to any conjugacy class in $W$, and show in particular that it is connected (that is, any two conjugate elements of $W$ differ only by a sequence of cyclic shifts and $K$-conjugations). Along the way, we obtain several results of independent interest, such as a description of the centraliser of an infinite order element $w\in W$, as well as the existence of natural decompositions of $w$ as a product of a ""torsion part"" and of a ""straight part"", with useful properties.

"  Consider a locally compact group $G=Q\ltimes V$ such that $V$ is abelian and the action of $Q$ on the dual abelian group $\hat V$ has a free orbit of full measure. We show that such a group $G$ can be quantized in three equivalent ways: (1) by reflecting across the Galois object defined by the canonical irreducible representation of $G$ on $L^2(V)$; (2) by twisting the coproduct on the group von Neumann algebra of $G$ by a dual $2$-cocycle obtained from the $G$-equivariant Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of $V\times\hat V$; (3) by considering the bicrossed product defined by a matched pair of subgroups of $Q\ltimes\hat V$ both isomorphic to $Q$. In the simplest case of the $ax+b$ group over the reals, the dual cocycle in (2) is an analytic analogue of the Jordanian twist. It was first found by Stachura using different ideas. The equivalence of approaches (2) and (3) in this case implies that the quantum $ax+b$ group of Baaj-Skandalis is isomorphic to the quantum group defined by Stachura. Along the way we prove a number of results for arbitrary locally compact groups $G$. Using recent results of De Commer we show that a class of $G$-Galois objects is parametrized by certain cohomology classes in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$. This extends results of Wassermann and Davydov in the finite group case. A new phenomenon is that already the unit class in $H^2(G;\mathbb T)$ can correspond to a nontrivial Galois object. Specifically, we show that any nontrivial locally compact group $G$ with group von Neumann algebra a factor of type I admits a canonical cohomology class of dual $2$-cocycles such that the corresponding quantization of $G$ is neither commutative nor cocommutative.

We find that an auxiliary function having formal symmetry is very useful to predict the evolution of the classical information in the universal wave function. ",physics
"  Nonlinear metasurfaces incorporate many of the functionalities of their linear counterparts such as wavefront shaping but simultaneously they perform nonlinear optical transformations.

The nonlinear processes render some basic principles governing the functionality of linear metasurfaces not directly applicable, such as the superposition principle and the geometric optics approximation. On the other hand, nonlinear metasurfaces facilitate new phenomena that are not possible in the linear regime. Here, we study the imaging of objects through a dielectric nonlinear metalens. We illuminate objects by infrared light and record their generated images at the visible third-harmonic wavelengths.

"  Asymptotic particle states in four-dimensional celestial scattering amplitudes are labelled by their $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Lorentz/conformal weights $(h,\bar{h})$ rather than the usual energy-momentum four-vector. These boost eigenstates involve a superposition of all energies. As such, celestial gluon (or photon) scattering cannot obey the usual (energetically) soft theorems. In this paper we show that tree-level celestial gluon scattering, in theories with sufficiently soft UV behavior, instead obeys conformally soft theorems involving $h \to 0$ or $\bar{h} \to 0$. Unlike the energetically soft theorem, the conformally soft theorem cannot be derived from low-energy effective field theory. ",high energy physics theory
"  Motivated by the conjectures formulated in 2003 by Tun\c{c}el et al., we study interlacing properties of the eigenvalues of $A\otimes B + B\otimes A$ for pairs of $n$-by-$n$ matrices $A, B$. We prove that for every pair of symmetric matrices (and skew-symmetric matrices) with one of them at most rank two, the \emph{odd spectrum} (those eigenvalues determined by skew-symmetric eigenvectors) of $A\otimes B + B\otimes A$ interlaces its \emph{even spectrum} (those eigenvalues determined by symmetric eigenvectors). Using this result, we also show that when $n \leq 3$, the odd spectrum of $A\otimes B + B\otimes A$ interlaces its even spectrum for every pair $A, B$. The interlacing results also specify the structure of the eigenvectors corresponding to the extreme eigenvalues. In addition, we identify where the conjecture(s) and some interlacing properties hold for a number of structured matrices. We settle the conjectures of Tun\c{c}el et al. and show they fail for some pairs of symmetric matrices $A, B$, when $n\geq 4$ and the ranks of $A$ and $B$ are at least $3$. ",mathematics
"  Three-dimensional (3D) shape measurement devices and techniques are being rapidly adopted within a variety of industries and applications. As acquiring 3D range data becomes faster and more accurate it becomes more challenging to efficiently store, transmit, or stream this data.

This paper presents a novel method for reducing the depth range of a 3D geometry such that it can be stored within a 2D image using lower encoding frequencies (or a fewer number of encoding periods). This allows for smaller compressed file sizes to be achieved without a proportional increase in reconstruction errors. Further, as the proposed method occurs prior to encoding, it is readily compatible with a variety of existing image-based 3D range geometry compression methods.

"  We study the real-time dynamics of a small bubble of ""false vacuum"" in a quantum spin chain near criticality, where the low-energy physics is described by a relativistic (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory. Such a bubble can be thought of as a confined kink-antikink pair (a meson). We carefully construct bubbles so that particle production does not occur until the walls collide. To achieve this in the presence of strong correlations, we extend a Matrix Product State (MPS) ansatz for quasiparticle wavepackets [Van Damme et al., arXiv:1907.02474 (2019)] to the case of confined, topological quasiparticles. By choosing the wavepacket width and the bubble size appropriately, we avoid strong lattice effects and observe relativistic kink-antikink collisions. We use the MPS quasiparticle ansatz to detect scattering outcomes: In the Ising model, with transverse and longitudinal fields, we do not observe particle production despite nonintegrability (supporting recent observations of nonthermalizing mesonic states). With additional interactions, we see production of confined and unconfined particle pairs. Although we simulated these low-energy, few-particle events with moderate resources, we observe significant growth of entanglement with energy and with the number of collisions, suggesting that increasing either will ultimately exhaust our methods. Quantum devices, in contrast, are not limited by entanglement production, and promise to allow us to go far beyond classical methods. We anticipate that kink-antikink scattering in 1+1 dimensions will be an instructive benchmark problem for relatively near-term quantum devices. ",quantum physics

"  We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing SU UMa-type dwarf nova ASASSN-18aan. We observed the 2018 superoutburst with 2.3 mag brightening and found the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$) to be 0.149454(3) d, or 3.59 hr. This is longward of the period gap, establishing ASASSN-18aan as one of a small number of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The estimated mass ratio, ($q=M_2/M_1 = 0.278(1)$), is almost identical to the upper limit of tidal instability by the 3:1 resonance. From eclipses, we found that the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst may reach the 3:1 resonance radius, suggesting that the superoutburst of ASASSN-18aan results from the tidal instability. Considering the case of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, we suggest that the tidal dissipation at the tidal truncation radius is enough to induce SU UMa-like behavior in relatively high-$q$ systems such as SU UMa-type dwarf novae, but that this is no longer effective in low-$q$ systems such as WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The unusual nature of the system extends to the secondary star, for which we find a spectral type of G9, much earlier than typical for the orbital period, and a secondary mass $M_2$ of around 0.18 M$_{\odot}$, smaller than expected for the orbital period and the secondary's spectral type. We also see indications of enhanced sodium abundance in the secondary's spectrum. Anomalously hot secondaries are seen in a modest number of other CVs and related objects. These systems evidently underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of mass transfer. In the case of ASASSN-18aan, this apparently resulted in a mass ratio lower than typically found at the system's $P_{\rm orb}$, which may account for the occurrence of a superoutburst at this relatively long period.

"  We study four coupled SYK models and nearly AdS$_2$ gravities. In the SYK model side, we construct a model that couples two copies of two coupled SYK models. In nearly AdS$_2$ gravity side, we entangle matter fields in two copies of traversable wormholes. In both cases, the systems show first order phase transitions at zero temperature by changing couplings, which is understood as the exchange of traversable wormhole configurations. In nearly AdS$_2$ gravity cases, by exchanging the role of space and time the wormholes are interpreted as bra-ket wormholes. In Lorentzian signature, these bra-ket wormholes lead to two closed universes that are entangled with each other as well as matter fields in the flat space without dynamical gravity. We study the effect of projection or entangling operation for matters on flat spaces and they cause phase transitions in bra-ket wormholes, which leads to the pair annihilation of closed universes. Using these bra-ket wormholes, we discuss the way to embed states in 2d holographic CFTs into Hilbert space of many 2d free fields. ",high energy physics theory
"  Low-Power Wide-Area Networks operating in the unlicensed bands are being deployed to connect a rapidly growing number of Internet-of-Things devices. While the unlicensed sub-GHz band offers favorable propagation for long-range connections, measurements show that the energy consumption of the nodes is still mostly dominated by the wireless transmission affecting their autonomy. We investigate the potential benefits of deploying massive MIMO technology to increase system reliability and at the same time support low-energy devices with good coverage at sub-GHz frequencies. The impact of different antenna configurations and propagation conditions is analyzed. Both actual average experienced array gain and channel hardening are examined. The assessment demonstrates the effect of channel hardening as well as the potential benefits of the experienced array gain. These measurements serve as a first assessment of the channel conditions of massive MIMO at sub-GHz frequencies and are, to the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind.

"  Reducing a 6d fivebrane theory on a 3-manifold $Y$ gives a $q$-series 3-manifold invariant $\widehat{Z}(Y)$. We analyse the large-$N$ behaviour of $F_K=\widehat{Z}(M_K)$, where $M_K$ is the complement of a knot $K$ in the 3-sphere, and explore the relationship between an $a$-deformed ($a=q^N$) version of $F_{K}$ and HOMFLY-PT polynomials. On the one hand, in combination with counts of holomorphic annuli on knot complements, this gives an enumerative interpretation of $F_K$ in terms of counts of open holomorphic curves. On the other, it leads to closed form expressions for $a$-deformed $F_K$ for $(2,2p+1)$-torus knots. They suggest a further $t$-deformation based on superpolynomials, which can be used to obtain a $t$-deformation of ADO polynomials, expected to be related to categorification. Moreover, studying how $F_K$ transforms under natural geometric operations on $K$ indicates relations to quantum modularity in a new setting. ",high energy physics theory
"  Metal nanostructures are key elements in nanooptics owing to their strong resonant interaction with light through local plasmonic charge oscillations. Their ability to shape light at the nanoscale have made them important across a multitude of areas, including biosensing, energy conversion and ultrathin flat metaoptics. Yet another dimension of avenues is foreseen for dynamic nanoantennas, ranging from tuneable metalenses for miniaturized medical devices to adaptable windows that control radiation flows in and out of buildings. However, enabling nano-optical antennas to be dynamically controllable remains highly challenging and particularly so for traditional metals with fixed permittivity. Here we present state-of-the-art conductive polymers as a new class of organic plasmonic materials for redox-tuneable nano-optics. Through experiments and simulations, we show that nanodisks of highly conductive polymers can provide clear optical extinction peaks via excitation of dipolar localised surface plasmon resonances. Resonance frequencies redshift with increasing nanodisk aspect ratio, in agreement with analytical calculations based on dipolar polarizability theory. We furthermore demonstrate complete switching of the optical response of the organic nanoantennas by chemical tuning of the polymer's redox state, which effectively modulates the material permittivity between plasmonic and non-plasmonic regimes. Our results thereby show that conductive polymer nanostructures can act as redox-tuneable plasmonic nanoantennas, based on bipolaronic charge carriers rather than electrons as in conventional metals. Future directions may investigate different polymers and geometries to further widen the plasmonic spectral range (here around 0.8 to 3.6 {\mu}m) as well as different ways of tuning. ",physics
"  The notion of tree network has sparked renewed interest in recent years, particularly in computer science and biology (neural network). However, this notion is usually interpreted in an extremely restrictive way: essentially linked to data processing, today tree networks are hybrid network topologies in which star networks are generally interconnected via bus networks. These networks are, most often, hierarchical and regular, and each of their nodes can have an arbitrary number of child nodes. At the outset, however, the notion of tree network, introduced in 1936 by Belgian physicist Julien Pacotte, was quite different: more general and, at the same time, more constrained, it should also serve an ambitious objective: the reconstruction of mathematics from concrete empirical structures. Usually poorly commented on and poorly understood (especially by philosophers), it had no real posterity. In this article, we first try to clarify this notion of ""tree network"" in the sense of Julien Pacotte, which makes it possible to eliminate the bad interpretations to which this notion has given rise. To this end, we use the language and concepts of graph theory and formalize the main properties of these networks which, contrary to popular belief, are not, in general, trees. In a second part, we then try to follow and explain, step by step, how Pacotte intended, using concepts borrowed from projective geometry, to reconstruct all of mathematics from such a network.

"  Superfluid vortices are quantum excitations carrying quantized amount of orbital angular momentum in a phase where global symmetry is spontaneously broken. We address a question of whether magnetic vortices in superconductors with dynamical gauge fields can carry nonzero orbital angular momentum or not. We discuss the angular momentum conservation in several distinct classes of examples from crossdisciplinary fields of physics across condensed matter, dense nuclear systems, and cosmology. The angular momentum carried by gauge field configurations around the magnetic vortex plays a crucial role in satisfying the principle of the conservation law. Based on various ways how the angular momentum conservation is realized, we provide a general scheme of classifying magnetic vortices in different phases of matter. ",high energy physics theory

"  This paper investigates the channel aging problem of light-fidelity (LiFi) systems. In the LiFi physical layer, the majority of the optimization problems for mobile users are nonconvex and require the use of dual decomposition or heuristics techniques. Such techniques are based on iterative algorithms, and often, cause a high processing time at the physical layer. Hence, the obtained solutions are no longer optimal since the LiFi channels are evolving. In this paper, a proactive-optimization approach that can alleviate the LiFi channel aging problem is proposed. The core idea is to design a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network that is capable of predicting posterior positions and orientations of mobile users, which can be then used to predict their channel coefficients. Consequently, the obtained channel coefficients can be exploited for deriving near-optimal transmission-schemes prior to the intended service-time, which enables real-time service. Through various simulations, the performance of the designed LSTM model is evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy and time. Finally, the performance of the proposed PO approach is investigated in the sum rate maximization problem of multiuser cell-free LiFi systems with quality-of-service constraints, where a performance gap of less than 7% is achieved, while eliminating up to 100% of the online processing-time.

"  We derive forms of light-state dominance for correlators in CFT$_d$, making precise the sense in which correlators can be approximated by the contribution of light operator exchanges. Our main result is that the four-point function of operators with dimension $\Delta$ is approximated, with bounded error, by the contribution of operators with scaling dimension below $\Delta_c > 2\Delta$ in the appropriate OPE channel. Adapting an existing modular invariance argument, we use crossing symmetry to show that the heavy-state contribution is suppressed by a relative factor of $e^{2\Delta-\Delta_c}$. We extend this result to the first sheet and derivatives of the correlator. Further exploiting technical similarities between crossing and modular invariance, we prove analogous results for the $2d$ partition function along the way.   We then turn to effective field theory in gapped theories and AdS/CFT, and make some general comments about the effect of integrating out heavy particles in the bulk. Combining our bounds with the Lorentzian OPE inversion formula we show that, under certain conditions, light-state dominance implies that integrating out heavy exchanges leads to higher-derivative couplings suppressed at large $\Delta_{gap}$.

"  Bars and Sezgin have proposed a super Yang-Mills theory in $D=s+t=11+3$ space-time dimensions with an electric 3-brane that generalizes the 2-brane of M-theory. More recently, the authors found an infinite family of exceptional super Yang-Mills theories in $D=(8n+3)+3$ via the so-called Magic Star algebras. A particularly interesting case occurs in signature $D=27+3$, where the superalgebra is centrally extended by an electric 11-brane and its 15-brane magnetic dual. The worldvolume symmetry of the 11-brane has signature $D=11+3$ and can reproduce super Yang-Mills theory in $D=11+3$. Upon reduction to $D=26+2$, the 11-brane reduces to a 10-brane with $10+2$ worldvolume signature. A single time projection gives a $10+1$ worldvolume signature and can serve as a model for $D=10+1$ M-theory as a reduction from the $D=26+1$ signature of the bosonic M-theory of Horowitz and Susskind; this is further confirmed by the reduction of chiral $(1,0)$, $D=11+3$ superalgebra to the $\mathcal{N}=1$ superalgebra in $D=10+1$, as found by Rudychev, Sezgin and Sundell some time ago. Extending previous results of Dijkgraaf, Verlinde and Verlinde, we also put forward the realization of spinors as total cohomologies of (the largest spatially extended) branes which centrally extend the $(1,0)$ superalgebra underlying the corresponding exceptional super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, by making use of an ""anomalous"" Dynkin embedding, we strengthen Ramond and Sati's argument that M-theory has hidden Cayley plane fibers. ",high energy physics theory
"  Quantum computers can be used for supervised learning by treating parametrised quantum circuits as models that map data inputs to predictions. While a lot of work has been done to investigate practical implications of this approach, many important theoretical properties of these models remain unknown. Here we investigate how the strategy with which data is encoded into the model influences the expressive power of parametrised quantum circuits as function approximators. We show that one can naturally write a quantum model as a partial Fourier series in the data, where the accessible frequencies are determined by the nature of the data encoding gates in the circuit. By repeating simple data encoding gates multiple times, quantum models can access increasingly rich frequency spectra. We show that there exist quantum models which can realise all possible sets of Fourier coefficients, and therefore, if the accessible frequency spectrum is asymptotically rich enough, such models are universal function approximators.

  The first analytic topologically non-trivial solutions in the (3+1)-dimensional gauged non-linear sigma model representing multi-solitons at finite volume with manifest ordered structures generating their own electromagnetic field are presented. The complete set of seven coupled non-linear field equations of the gauged non-linear sigma model together with the corresponding Maxwell equations are reduced in a self-consistent way to just one linear Schrodinger-like equation in two dimensions. The corresponding two dimensional periodic potential can be computed explicitly in terms of the solitons profile. The present construction keeps alive the topological charge of the gauged solitons. Both the energy density and the topological charge density are periodic and the positions of their peaks show a crystalline order. These solitons describe configurations in which (most of) the topological charge and total energy are concentrated within three-dimensional tube-shaped regions. The electric and magnetic fields vanish in the center of the tubes and take their maximum values on their surface while the electromagnetic current is contained within these tube-shaped regions. Electromagnetic perturbations of these families of gauged solitons are shortly discussed. ,high energy physics theory

At each order we verify that the (permissive) boundary conditions at the orientifolds are satisfied.

"  We obtain several fundamental results on finite index ideals and additive subgroups of rings as well as on model-theoretic connected components of rings, which concern generating in finitely many steps inside additive groups of rings.   Let $R$ be any ring equipped with an arbitrary additional first order structure, and $A$ a set of parameters. We show that whenever $H$ is an $A$-definable, finite index subgroup of $(R,+)$, then $H+RH$ contains an $A$-definable, two-sided ideal of finite index. As a corollary, we positively answer Question 3.9 of [Bohr compactifications of groups and rings, J. Gismatullin, G. Jagiella and K. Krupi\'nski]: if $R$ is unital, then $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A = \bar R^{00}_A$, where $\bar R \succ R$ is a sufficiently saturated elementary extension of $R$, and $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ [resp. $\bar R^{00}_A$] is the smallest $A$-type-definable, bounded index additive subgroup [resp. ideal] of $\bar R$. This implies that $\bar R^{00}_A=\bar R^{000}_A$, where $\bar R^{000}_A$ is the smallest invariant over $A$, bounded index ideal of $\bar R$. If $R$ is of finite characteristic (not necessarily unital), we get a sharper result: $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A = \bar R^{00}_A$. We obtain similar results for finitely generated (not necessarily unital) rings and for topological rings. The above results imply that the simplified descriptions of the definable (so also classical) Bohr compactifications of triangular groups over unital rings obtained in Corollary 3.5 of the aforementioned paper are valid for all unital rings.   We analyze many examples, where we compute the number of steps needed to generate a group by $(\bar R \cup \{1\}) \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ and study related aspects, showing ""optimality"" of some of our main results and answering some natural questions.

"  Dual-continuum (DC) models can be tractable alternatives to explicit approaches for the numerical modelling of multiscale materials with multiphysics behaviours. This work concerns the conceptual and numerical modelling of poroelastically coupled dual-scale materials such as naturally fractured rock. Apart from a few exceptions, previous poroelastic DC models have assumed isotropy of the constituents and the dual-material. Additionally, it is common to assume that only one continuum has intrinsic stiffness properties. Finally, little has been done into validating whether the DC paradigm can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of explicit numerical representations at the DC modelling scale. We address the aforementioned knowledge gaps in two steps. First, we utilise a homogenisation approach based on Levin's theorem to develop a previously derived anisotropic poroelastic constitutive model. Our development incorporates anisotropic intrinsic stiffness properties of both continua. This addition is in analogy to anisotropic fractured rock masses with stiff fractures. Second, we perform numerical modelling to test the dual-continuum model against fine-scale explicit equivalents. In doing, we present our hybrid numerical framework, as well as the conditions required for interpretation of the numerical results. The tests themselves progress from materials with isotropic to anisotropic mechanical and flow properties. The fine-scale simulations show anisotropy can have noticeable effects on deformation and flow behaviour. However, our numerical experiments show the DC approach can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of both isotropic and anisotropic fine-scale representations. ",physics
"  Sequential Residual Methods try to solve nonlinear systems of equations $F(x)=0$ by iteratively updating the current approximate solution along a residual-related direction. Therefore, memory requirements are minimal and, consequently, these methods are attractive for solving large-scale nonlinear systems.

Anderson-like accelerations are widely used in electronic structure calculations to improve a fixed point algorithm for finding Self Consistent Field (SCF) solutions of Hartree-Fock models. In this paper, it is showed how to apply this type of acceleration to Sequential Residual Methods. The performance of the resulting algorithm is illustrated by applying it to the solution of very large problems coming from the discretization of partial differential equations. ",mathematics

This representation is most easily discussed in the light cone formalism and we show that the duality relations found in E theory take a particularly simple form in this formalism. We explain that the mysterious symmetries found recently in the light cone formulation of maximal supergravity theories are part of E11. We also argue that our familiar spacetimes have to be extended by additional coordinates when considering extended objects such as branes. ",high energy physics theory
"  Cosmological probes pose an inverse problem where the measurement result is obtained through observations, and the objective is to infer values of model parameters which characterize the underlying physical system -- our Universe. Modern cosmological probes increasingly rely on measurements of the small-scale structure, and the only way to accurately model physical behavior on those scales, roughly 65 Mpc/h or smaller, is via expensive numerical simulations. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of a novel statistical framework for obtaining accurate parameter constraints by combining observations with a very limited number of cosmological simulations. The proposed framework utilizes multi-output Gaussian process emulators that are adaptively constructed using Bayesian optimization methods. We compare several approaches for constructing multi-output emulators that enable us to take possible inter-output correlations into account while maintaining the efficiency needed for inference. Using Lyman alpha forest flux power spectrum, we demonstrate that our adaptive approach requires considerably fewer --- by a factor of a few in Lyman alpha P(k) case considered here --- simulations compared to the emulation based on Latin hypercube sampling, and that the method is more robust in reconstructing parameters and their Bayesian credible intervals.

"  We study generalized discrete symmetries of quantum field theories in 1+1D generated by topological defect lines with no inverse. In particular, we describe 't Hooft anomalies and classify gapped phases stabilized by these symmetries, including new 1+1D topological phases.

Such data defines a Turaev-Viro/Levin-Wen model in 2+1D, while a 1+1D system with this fusion category acting as a global symmetry defines a boundary condition. This is akin to gauging a discrete global symmetry at the boundary of Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. We describe how to ""ungauge"" the fusion category symmetry in these boundary conditions and separate the symmetry-preserving phases from the symmetry-breaking ones. For Tambara-Yamagami categories and their generalizations, which are associated with Kramers-Wannier-like self-dualities under orbifolding, we develop gauge theoretic techniques which simplify the analysis.

"  Automatic meeting analysis is an essential fundamental technology required to let, e.g. smart devices follow and respond to our conversations. To achieve an optimal automatic meeting analysis, we previously proposed an all-neural approach that jointly solves source separation, speaker diarization and source counting problems in an optimal way (in a sense that all the 3 tasks can be jointly optimized through error back-propagation). It was shown that the method could well handle simulated clean (noiseless and anechoic) dialog-like data, and achieved very good performance in comparison with several conventional methods. However, it was not clear whether such all-neural approach would be successfully generalized to more complicated real meeting data containing more spontaneously-speaking speakers, severe noise and reverberation, and how it performs in comparison with the state-of-the-art systems in such scenarios. In this paper, we first consider practical issues required for improving the robustness of the all-neural approach, and then experimentally show that, even in real meeting scenarios, the all-neural approach can perform effective speech enhancement, and simultaneously outperform state-of-the-art systems.

"  Many cool stars possess complex magnetic fields [1] that are considered to undertake a central role in the structuring and energising of their atmospheres [2]. Alfv\'enic waves are thought to make a critical contribution to energy transfer along these magnetic fields, with the potential to heat plasma and accelerate stellar winds [3] [4] [5]. Despite Alfv\'enic waves having been identified in the Sun's atmosphere, the nature of the basal wave energy flux is poorly understood. It is generally assumed that the associated Poynting flux is generated solely in the photosphere and propagates into the corona, typically through the continuous buffeting of magnetic fields by turbulent convective cells [4] [6] [7]. Here we provide evidence that the Sun's internal acoustic modes also contribute to the basal flux of Alfv\'enic waves, delivering a spatially ubiquitous input to the coronal energy balance that is sustained over the solar cycle. Alfv\'enic waves are thus a fundamental feature of the Sun's corona. Acknowledging that internal acoustic modes have a key role in injecting additional Poynting flux into the upper atmospheres of Sun-like stars has potentially significant consequences for the modelling of stellar coronae and winds.

Here we report the progress of understanding the mechanisms from examining the ZIF-8 aperture configuration variation using DFT and MD simulations. The results indicate that the pristine aperture configuration exhibits the best separation performance, and the addition of ILs prevents the apertures from large swing (i.e. configuration variation). Subsequently, the effect of IL viscosity on the layout variation was investigated. MD simulations also show that the pristine aperture configuration is more stabilized by ILs with large viscosity (0-87Cp). Further increase of IL viscosity above 87Cp did not result in noticeable changes in the aperture stability. ",physics

In one dimensional CFTs, the seed coefficient is the decomposition coefficient of the double-trace operator with the lowest conformal dimension. In higher dimensions, the seed coefficients are the coefficients of the double-trace operators with the minimal conformal twist.

"  Determining the architecture of multi-planetary systems is one of the cornerstones of understanding planet formation and evolution. Resonant systems are especially important as the fragility of their orbital configuration ensures that no significant scattering or collisional event has taken place since the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary disc was still present. In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular attention since the first TESS observations hinted at a 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the results of observations from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO, NGTS, and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the peculiar orbital architecture of the system. We show that TOI-178 harbours at least six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with radii ranging from 1.152(-0.070/+0.073) to 2.87(-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii and periods of 1.91, 3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days. All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain of Laplace resonances, and the planetary densities show important variations from planet to planet, jumping from 1.02(+0.28/-0.23) to 0.177(+0.055/-0.061) times the Earth's density between planets c and d. Using Bayesian interior structure retrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the planets does not vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from simple formation and evolution models and unlike other known systems in a chain of Laplace resonances. The brightness of TOI-178 allows for a precise characterisation of its orbital architecture as well as of the physical nature of the six presently known transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration and the diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable the study of interior planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing important clues on the formation of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

"  The standard benchmark for teleportation is the average fidelity of teleportation and according to this benchmark not all states are useful for teleportation. It was recently shown however that all entangled states lead to non-classical teleportation, with there being no classical scheme able to reproduce the states teleported to Bob. Here we study the operational significance of this result. On the one hand we demonstrate that every entangled state is useful for teleportation if a generalization of the average fidelity of teleportation is considered which concerns teleporting quantum correlations. On the other hand, we show the strength of a particular entangled state and entangled measurement for teleportation -- as quantified by the robustness of teleportation -- precisely characterizes their ability to offer an advantage in the task of subchannel discrimination with side information. This connection allows us to prove that every entangled state outperforms all separable states when acting as a quantum memory in this discrimination task. Finally, within the context of a resource theory of teleportation, we show that the two operational tasks considered provide complete sets of monotones for two partial orders based upon the notion of teleportation simulation, one classical, and one quantum.

"  In this paper we obtain the following stability result for periodic multi-solitons of the KdV equation: We prove that under any given semilinear Hamiltonian perturbation of small size $\varepsilon > 0$, a large class of periodic multi-solitons of the KdV equation, including ones of large amplitude, are orbitally stable for a time interval of length at least $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first stability result of such type for periodic multi-solitons of large size of an integrable PDE. ",mathematics
"  In this paper, the power flow in electrical systems is modelled in the time domain by using Geometric Algebra and the Hilbert Transform. The use of this mathematical framework overcomes some of the limitations shown by the existing methodologies under distorted supply or unbalanced load. In such cases, the derived instantaneous active current may not be the lowest RMS current in all circuit conditions and could contain higher levels of harmonic distortion than the supply voltage. Moreover, they cannot be applied to single phase systems. The proposed method can be used for sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal power supplies, non-linear loads, single- and multi-phase systems, and it provides meaningful engineering results with a compact formulation. Several examples have been included to prove the validity of the proposed theory. ",electrical engineering and systems science

Let $f:I\to I$ be a map such that each restriction $f|_{I_i}$ is an increasing Lipschitz contraction. We prove that any $f$ admits at most $k$ periodic orbits, where the upper bound is sharp. We are also interested in the dynamics of piecewise linear $\lambda$-affine maps, where $0<\lambda<1$.

"  Aims. The main purpose of this work is to provide a method to derive tabulated observational constraints on the halo mass function (HMF) by studying the magnification bias effect on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies. Under the assumption of universality, we parametrize the HMF according to two traditional models, namely the Sheth and Tormen (ST) and Tinker fits and assess their performance in explaining the measured data within the {\Lambda} cold dark matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. We also study the potential influence of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in this analysis and discuss two important aspects regarding the HMF parametrization. Methods. We measure the cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies with redshifts in the range $0.2<z<0.8$ and a background sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with redshifts in the range $1.2<z<4.0$ and carry out an MCMC algorithm to check this observable against its mathematical prediction within the halo model formalism. Results. If all HMF parameters are assumed to be positive, the ST fit only seems to fully explain the measurements by forcing the mean number of satellite galaxies in a halo to increase substantially from its prior mean value. The Tinker fit, on the other hand, provides a robust description of the data without relevant changes in the HOD parameters, but with some dependence on the prior range of two of its parameters. When the normalization condition for the HMF is dropped and we allow negative values of the $p_1$ parameter in the ST fit, all the involved parameters are better determined, unlike the previous models, thus deriving the most general HMF constraints. While all cases are in agreement with the traditional fits within the uncertainties, the last one hints at a slightly higher number of halos at intermediate and high masses, raising the important point of the allowed parameter range.

States which are not classical mixtures of stabilizer states are known as ""magic states"" and play a key role in quantum resource theory. By implementing a particular magic monotone known as the ""mana"" we quantify the magic of knot and link states. In particular, for $SU(2)_k$ Chern-Simons theory we show that knot and link states are generically magical. For link states, we further investigate the mana associated to correlations between separate boundaries which characterizes the state's long-range magic. Our numerical results suggest that the magic of a majority of link states is entirely long-range. We make these statements sharper for torus links. ",high energy physics theory

With straightforward schoolbook methods this would result in a quadratic number of Toffoli gates and a linear number of CNOT gates.

"  We propose a categorial grammar based on classical multiplicative linear logic.   This can be seen as an extension of abstract categorial grammars (ACG) and is at least as expressive. However, constituents of {\it linear logic grammars (LLG)} are not abstract ${\lambda}$-terms, but simply tuples of words with labeled endpoints and supplied with specific {\it plugging instructions}: the sets of endpoints are subdivided into the {\it incoming} and the {\it outgoing} parts. We call such objects {\it word cobordisms}.   A key observation is that word cobordisms can be organized in a category, very similar to the familiar category of topological cobordisms. This category is symmetric monoidal closed and compact closed and thus is a model of linear $\lambda$-calculus and classical, as well as intuitionistic linear logic. This allows us using linear logic as a typing system for word cobordisms.   At least, this gives a concrete and intuitive representation of ACG.   We think, however, that the category of word cobordisms, which has a rich structure and is independent of any grammar, might be interesting on its own right. ",mathematics

"  In this work we revisit the topological mass generation of 2-forms and establish a connection to the unique derivative coupling arising in the quartic Lagrangian of the systematic construction of massive $2-$form interactions, relating in this way BF theories to Galileon-like theories of 2-forms. In terms of a massless $1-$form $A$ and a massless $2-$form $B$, the topological term manifests itself as the interaction $B\wedge F$, where $F = {\rm d} A$ is the field strength of the $1-$form. Such an interaction leads to a mechanism of generation of mass, usually referred to as ""topological generation of mass"" in which the single degree of freedom propagated by the $2-$form is absorbed by the $1-$form, generating a massive mode for the $1-$form. Using the systematical construction in terms of the Levi-Civita tensor, it was shown that, apart from the quadratic and quartic Lagrangians, Galileon-like derivative self-interactions for the massive 2-form do not exist. A unique quartic Lagrangian $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\epsilon^{\alpha\beta\gamma}_{\;\;\;\;\;\;\sigma}\partial_{\mu}B_{\alpha\rho}\partial_{\nu}B_{\beta\gamma}$ arises in this construction in a way that it corresponds to a total derivative on its own but ceases to be so once an overall general function is introduced. We show that it exactly corresponds to the same interaction of topological mass generation. Based on the decoupling limit analysis of the interactions, we bring out supporting arguments for the uniqueness of such a topological mass term and absence of the Galileon-like interactions. Finally, we discuss some preliminary applications in cosmology. ",high energy physics theory

"  We study the relations between entropy computed using the island prescription, von Neumann entropy, and coarse grained entropy in a doubly-holographic model. In this model an eternal AdS black hole with a Planck brane has two dual boundary formulations: a BCFT coupled to additional degrees of freedom at its boundary, and an effective CFT in thermal equilibrium with a semi-classical eternal black hole. Assuming entanglement wedge reconstruction, we show that the homology condition for bulk RT surfaces depends on which of the dual boundary formulations is taken. The island formula in the effective description computes the von Neumann entropy in the BCFT description. The von Neumann entropy in the effective description is a coarse grained entropy in the BCFT description. Simple operators which act on the radiation are identical in both formulations, while complex operators map non-locally. We use a toy model to demonstrate how such a map between two descriptions of the system gives rise to the island formula and wormholes. We conjecture that black hole complementarity is realized analogously to the doubly-holographic situation. A black hole can either be described as quantum gravitational object with structure near the horizon, or as a semi-classical black hole which respects the equivalence principle but never releases its information. The latter description is only valid if we allow observers to only act with sufficiently simple operators. Information is never cloned in either description. ",high energy physics theory
"  In order to investigate possible topological vortex structures in generalized models, we developed a perturbative generation approach for scalar-vector theories. We demonstrate explicitly that the dielectric permeability functions must have a nonpolynomial shape, i. e., the form of the logarithmic function. Basing on this result, we built models in $(2+1)D$ with logarithmic dielectric permeability in order to investigate the presence of topological vortex structures in a Maxwell model. This type of scalar-vector models is important because they can generate stationary field solutions in theories describing the dynamics of the scalar field. As examples, we chose models of the complex scalar field coupled to the Maxwell field. Subsequently, we investigated the model's Bogomol'nyi equations to describe the field configurations. Then, we demonstrate numerically, for an ansatz with rotational symmetry, that the solutions of the complex scalar field generating minimum energy configurations are topological structures depending on the parameters obtained in the perturbative generation of the vector-scalar theory.

"  This white paper is motivated by open questions in star formation, which can be uniquely addressed by high resolution X-ray imaging and require an X-ray observatory with large collecting area along good spectral resolution. A complete census of star-forming regions in X-rays, combined with well matched infrared (IR) data, will advance our understanding of disk survival times and dissipation mechanisms. In addition, we will be able to directly observe the effects of X-ray irradiation on circumstellar grain growth to compare with grain evolution models in both high- and low-UV environments. X-rays are native to stars at all phases of star formation and affect planet-forming disks especially through flares. Moreover, X-rays trace magnetic fields which weave through the flares, providing a unique, non-gravitational feedback mechanism between disk and star. Finally, the bright X-ray emission emanating from hot plasma associated with massive stars can have large scale impacts on the topology of star-forming regions and their interface with the interstellar medium (ISM).

"  Non-trivial topological behavior appears in many different contexts in statistical physics, perhaps the most known one being the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the two dimensional XY model. We study the behavior of a simpler, one dimensional, XY chain with periodic boundary and strong interactions; but rather than concentrating on the equilibrium measure we try to understand its dynamics. The equivalent of the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in this one dimensional case happens when the interaction strength scales like the size of the system $N$, yet we show that a sharp transition for the dynamics occurs at the scale of $\log N$ -- when the interactions are weaker than a certain threshold topological phases could not be observed over long times, while for interactions that are stronger than that threshold topological phases become metastable, surviving for diverging time scales.

"  In this paper, we propose a compositional approach for the construction of finite abstractions (a.k.a. finite Markov decision processes (MDPs)) for networks of discrete-time stochastic control subsystems that are not necessarily stabilizable. The proposed approach leverages the interconnection topology and a notion of finite-step stochastic storage functions, that describes joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their abstractions, and establishes a finite-step stochastic simulation function as a relation between the network and its abstraction. To this end, we first develop a new type of compositionality conditions which is less conservative than the existing ones. In particular, using a relaxation via a finite-step stochastic simulation function, it is possible to construct finite abstractions such that stabilizability of each subsystem is not necessarily required. We then propose an approach to construct finite MDPs together with their corresponding finite-step storage functions for general discrete-time stochastic control systems satisfying an incremental passivablity property. We also construct finite MDPs for a particular class of nonlinear stochastic control systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results, we apply our results on three different case studies. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  We consider Galois/monodromy groups arising in computer vision applications, with a view towards building more efficient polynomial solvers. The Galois/monodromy group allows us to decide when a given problem decomposes into algebraic subproblems, and whether or not it has any symmetries. Tools from numerical algebraic geometry and computational group theory allow us to apply this framework to classical and novel reconstruction problems. We consider three classical cases--3-point absolute pose, 5-point relative pose, and 4-point homography estimation for calibrated cameras--where the decomposition and symmetries may be naturally understood in terms of the Galois/monodromy group. We then show how our framework can be applied to novel problems from absolute and relative pose estimation. For instance, we discover new symmetries for absolute pose problems involving mixtures of point and line features. We also describe a problem of estimating a pair of calibrated homographies between three images. For this problem of degree 64, we can reduce the degree to 16; the latter better reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of algebraically solving the problem. As a byproduct, we obtain new constraints on compatible homographies, which may be of independent interest. ",mathematics

"  One of the major goals of next-generation space-borne and ground-based telescopes is to detect and characterize the first galaxies that were in place in the first few hundred million years after the big bang. We study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the first galaxies and discuss the prospects for detection and identification. We consider very young star-forming galaxies at $z=15$ and incorporate the contribution from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars. Unlike in the present-day galaxies, primordial protostars are not embedded in dusty gas clouds, and hence the light from them can be visible at a wide range of wavelengths. We use MESA code to follow the PMS evolution and use the BT-Settl model to calculate the SED of individual PMS stars. We show that PMS stars contribute to boost the flux in the mid-infrared, and that the galaxy SED at very early evolutionary phases is overall redder than at later phases. The infrared flux contribution is comparable to that caused by emission lines powered by massive stars. We argue that the contribution from PMS stars is important for characterizing young galaxies in the early Universe and also for target selection with future deep galaxy surveys. ",astrophysics

The sound confinement is robust to frequency as well as spatial disorder at the interface, as long as the interface related edge mode is situated within the band gap. A closed acoustic circuit was formed by introducing controlled disorder in the HR units at the corners, indicating the possibility of confining sound to a point. ",physics
"  Many challenges faced in today's semiconductor devices are related to self-heating phenomena. The optimization of device designs can be assisted by numerical simulations using the non-isothermal drift-diffusion system, where the magnitude of the thermoelectric cross effects is controlled by the Seebeck coefficient. We show that the model equations take a remarkably simple form when assuming the so-called Kelvin formula for the Seebeck coefficient. The corresponding heat generation rate involves exactly the three classically known self-heating effects, namely Joule, recombination and Thomson-Peltier heating, without any further (transient) contributions. Moreover, the thermal driving force in the electrical current density expressions can be entirely absorbed in the diffusion coefficient via a generalized Einstein relation. The efficient numerical simulation relies on an accurate and robust discretization technique for the fluxes (finite volume Scharfetter-Gummel method), which allows to cope with the typically stiff solutions of the semiconductor device equations. We derive two non-isothermal generalizations of the Scharfetter-Gummel scheme for degenerate semiconductors (Fermi-Dirac statistics) obeying the Kelvin formula. The approaches differ in the treatment of degeneration effects: The first is based on an approximation of the discrete generalized Einstein relation implying a specifically modified thermal voltage, whereas the second scheme follows the conventionally used approach employing a modified electric field. We present a detailed analysis and comparison of both schemes, indicating a superior performance of the modified thermal voltage scheme. ",physics
"  This paper develops a data-driven toolkit for traffic forecasting using high-resolution (a.k.a. event-based) traffic data. This is the raw data obtained from fixed sensors in urban roads. Time series of such raw data exhibit heavy fluctuations from one time step to the next (typically on the order of 0.1-1 second). Short-term forecasts (10-30 seconds into the future) of traffic conditions are critical for traffic operations applications (e.g., adaptive signal control). But traffic forecasting tools in the literature deal predominantly with 3-5 minute aggregated data, where the typical signal cycle is on the order of 2 minutes. This renders such forecasts useless at the operations level. To this end, we model the traffic forecasting problem as a matrix completion problem, where the forecasting inputs are mapped to a higher dimensional space using kernels. The formulation allows us to capture both nonlinear dependencies between forecasting inputs and outputs but also allows us to capture dependencies among the inputs. These dependencies correspond to correlations between different locations in the network. We further employ adaptive boosting to enhance the training accuracy and capture historical patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed methods is verified using high-resolution data obtained from a real-world traffic network in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  This paper considers an Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario in which devices sporadically transmit short packets with few pilot symbols over a fading channel. Devices are characterized by unique transmission non-idealities, such as I/Q imbalance. The number of pilots is generally insufficient to obtain an accurate estimate of the end-to-end channel, which includes the effects of fading and of the transmission-side distortion. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by using meta-learning. Accordingly, pilots from previous IoT transmissions are used as meta-training data in order to train a demodulator that is able to quickly adapt to new end-to-end channel conditions from few pilots. Various state-of-the-art meta-learning schemes are adapted to the problem at hand and evaluated, including Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), First-Order MAML (FOMAML), REPTILE, and fast Context Adaptation VIA meta-learning (CAVIA). Both offline and online solutions are developed. In the latter case, an integrated online meta-learning and adaptive pilot number selection scheme is proposed. Numerical results validate the advantages of meta-learning as compared to training schemes that either do not leverage prior transmissions or apply a standard joint learning algorithms on previously received data.

"  We increase the sample of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in lower density environments with characterized globular cluster (GC) populations using new Hubble Space Telescope observations of nine UDGs in group environments. While the bulk of our UDGs have GC abundances consistent with normal dwarf galaxies, two of these UDGs have excess GC populations. These two UDGs both have GC luminosity functions consistent with higher surface brightness galaxies and cluster UDGs. We then combine our nine objects with previous studies to create a catalog of UDGs with analyzed GC populations that spans a uniquely diverse range of environments. We use this catalog to examine broader trends in the GC populations of low stellar mass galaxies. The highest GC abundances are found in cluster UDGs, but whether cluster UDGs are actually more extreme requires study of many more UDGs in groups. We find a possible positive correlation between GC abundance and stellar mass, and between GC abundance and galaxy size at fixed stellar mass. However, we see no significant stellar-mass galaxy-size relation, over our limited stellar mass range. We consider possible origins of the correlation between GC abundance and galaxy size, including the possibility that these two galaxy properties are both dependent on the galaxy dark matter halo, or that they are related through baryonic processes like internal feedback.

We conduct our analysis by approximating the eigenbasis of the associated absorbing quantum walk operator matrix Q_n where n is the lattice size. The conditional probability distributions of these finite absorbing quantum walks exhibit distinct behavior at various timescales, namely wavelike reflections for t = O(n), fractional quantum revivals for t = O(n^2), and stability for t = O(n^3). At the end of this paper, we demonstrate the existence of these quantum revivals in other sufficiently regular quantum walk systems. ",quantum physics

In the process, we calculate corrections to large spin OPE coefficients to one-loop and higher in holographic CFTs. ",high energy physics theory
  In a recent letter we suggested a natural generalization of the flat-space spinor-helicity formalism in four dimensions to anti-de Sitter space. In the present paper we give some technical details that were left implicit previously. For lower-spin fields we also derive potentials associated with the previously found plane wave solutions for field strengths. We then employ these potentials to evaluate some three-point amplitudes. This analysis illustrates a typical computation of an amplitude without internal lines in our formalism. ,high energy physics theory
"  In Team Semantics, a dependency notion is strongly first order if every sentence of the logic obtained by adding the corresponding atoms to First Order Logic is equivalent to some first order sentence. In this work it is shown that all nontrivial dependency atoms that are strongly first order, downwards closed, and relativizable (in the sense that the relativizations of the corresponding atoms with respect to some unary predicate are expressible in terms of them) are definable in terms of constancy atoms.   Additionally, it is shown that any strongly first order dependency is safe for any family of downwards closed dependencies, in the sense that every sentence of the logic obtained by adding to First Order Logic both the strongly first order dependency and the downwards closed dependencies is equivalent to some sentence of the logic obtained by adding only the downwards closed dependencies.

"  We investigate the Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole solution obtained from Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions with several assumptions. The origin of the microscopic entropy of this black hole is investigated using the conjectured Kerr/CFT correspondence which is originally proposed for extremal Kerr black holes. The isometry of the near-horizon extremal Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole shows that the asymptotic symmetry group may be implemented to compute the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Furthermore, by assuming Frolov-Thorne vacuum, the conformal temperatures can be obtained. Then by using the Cardy formula, the microscopic entropy is gained which matches the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also employ Cardy prescription to find the logarithmic correction of the entropy. Then at limit $ a \rightarrow 0 $, the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om-NUT solution is recovered and by enhancing with the fibered coordinate we find the five-dimensional (5D) solution. The second dual CFT is applied to this black hole to gain the entropy. Finally, the microscopic entropy is still in agreement with the area law of 5D black hole solution. Hence, the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om-NUT solution is holographically dual to the CFT. ",high energy physics theory
"  Cumulative hardness comparisons are a simple but statistically powerful test for the presence of gravitational lensing in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Since gravitational lensing does not change photon energies, all source images should have the same spectra -- and hence hardness. Applied to the recent claim that the two pulses in GRB 950830 are lensed images of the same pulse, the measured flux ratio between the two main pulses should be the same at all energies. After summing up all the counts in both of GRB 950830's two pulses in all four BATSE energy bands, it was found that in energy channel 3, the second pulse appears somewhat weak. In comparison with the other BATSE energy channels, the difference was statistically significant at above 90\%. This model-independent test indicates that the case for GRB 950830 involving a gravitational lens may be intriguing -- but should not be considered proven. ",astrophysics
"  We show that if X_n is a variety of cxn-matrices that is stable under the group Sym([n]) of column permutations and if forgetting the last column maps X_n into X_{n-1}, then the number of Sym([n])-orbits on irreducible components of X_n is a quasipolynomial in n for all sufficiently large n. To this end, we introduce the category of affine FI^op-schemes of width one, review existing literature on such schemes, and establish several new structural results about them. In particular, we show that under a shift and a localisation, any width-one FI^op-scheme becomes of product form, where X_n=Y^n for some scheme Y in affine c-space. Furthermore, to any FI^op-scheme of width one we associate a component functor from the category FI of finite sets with injections to the category PF of finite sets with partially defined maps. We present a combinatorial model for these functors and use this model to prove that Sym([n])-orbits of components of X_n, for all n, correspond bijectively to orbits of a groupoid acting on the integral points in certain rational polyhedral cones. Using the orbit-counting lemma for groupoids and theorems on quasipolynomiality of lattice point counts, this yields our Main Theorem. ",mathematics

"  A quantum network consists of independent sources distributing entangled states to distant nodes which can then perform entangled measurements, thus establishing correlations across the entire network. But how strong can these correlations be? Here we address this question, by deriving bounds on possible quantum correlations in a given network. These bounds are nonlinear inequalities that depend only on the topology of the network. We discuss in detail the notably challenging case of the triangle network. Moreover, we conjecture that our bounds hold in general no-signaling theories. In particular, we prove that our inequalities for the triangle network hold when the sources are arbitrary no-signaling boxes which can be wired together. Finally, we discuss an application of our results for the device-independent characterization of the topology of a quantum network. ",quantum physics
"  Stacks of superconducting tapes can trap much higher magnetic fields than conventional magnets. This makes them very promising for motors and generators. However, ripple magnetic fields in these machines present a cross-field component that demagnetizes the stacks. At present, there is no quantitative agreement between measurements and modeling of cross-field demagnetization, mainly due to the need of a 3D model that takes the end effects and real micron-thick superconducting layer into account. This article presents 3D modeling and measurements of cross-field demagnetization in stacks of up to 5 tapes and initial magnetization modeling of stacks of up to 15 tapes. 3D modeling of the cross-field demagnetization explicitly shows that the critical current density, $J_c$, in the direction perpendicular to the tape surface does not play a role in cross-field demagnetization. When taking the measured anisotropic magnetic field dependence of $J_c$ into account, 3D calculations agree with measurements with less than 4 % deviation, while the error of 2D modeling is much higher. Then, our 3D numerical methods can realistically predict cross-field demagnetization. Due to the force-free configuration of part of the current density, J, in the stack, better agreement with experiments will probably require measuring the Jc anisotropy for the whole solid angle range, including $J$ parallel to the magnetic field.

"  Zero-mode waveguides (ZMW) nanoapertures milled in metal films were proposed to improve the FRET efficiency and enable single molecule FRET detection beyond the 10 nm barrier, overcoming the restrictions of diffraction-limited detection in a homogeneous medium. However, the earlier ZMW demonstrations were limited to the Atto 550 - Atto 647N fluorophore pair, asking the question whether the FRET enhancement observation was an artefact related to this specific set of fluorescent dyes. Here, we use Alexa Fluor 546 and Alexa Fluor 647 to investigate single molecule FRET at large donor-acceptor separations exceeding 10 nm inside ZMWs. These Alexa fluorescent dyes feature a markedly different chemical structure, surface charge and hydrophobicity as compared to their Atto counterparts. Our single molecule data on Alexa 546 - Alexa 647 demonstrate enhanced FRET efficiencies at large separations exceeding 10 nm, extending the spatial range available for FRET and confirming the earlier conclusions. By showing that the FRET enhancement inside a ZMW does not depend on the set of fluorescent dyes, this report is an important step to establish the relevance of ZMWs to extend the sensitivity and detection range of FRET, while preserving its ability to work on regular fluorescent dye pairs.

"  Spin chains with symmetry-protected edge modes are promising candidates to realize intrinsically robust physical qubits that can be used for the storage and processing of quantum information. In any experimental realization of such physical systems, weak perturbations in the form of induced interactions and disorder are unavoidable and can be detrimental to the stored information. At the same time, the latter may in fact be beneficial; for instance by deliberately inducing disorder which causes the system to localize. In this work, we explore the potential of using an $XZX$ cluster Hamiltonian to encode quantum information into the local edge modes and comprehensively investigate the influence of both many-body interactions and disorder on their stability over time, adding substance to the narrative that many-body localization may stabilize quantum information. We recover the edge state at each time step, allowing us to reconstruct the quantum channel that captures the locally constrained out of equilibrium time evolution. With this representation in hand, we analyze how well classical and quantum information are preserved over time as a function of disorder and interactions. We find that the performance of the edge qubits varies dramatically between disorder realizations. Whereas some show a smooth decoherence over time, a sizeable fraction are rapidly rendered unusable as memories. We also find that the stability of the classical information -- a precursor for the usefulness of the chain as a quantum memory -- depends strongly on the direction in which the bit is encoded. When employing the chain as a genuine quantum memory, encoded qubits are most faithfully recovered for low interaction and high disorder. ",quantum physics
"  The new version of the gedanken experiment proposed by Sorce and Wald has been used to examine the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) for black holes at the second-order approximation of the matter fields perturbation. However, only considering the perturbation until the second-order approximation is incomplete because there is an optimal option such that the existing condition of the event horizon vanishes at second-order. For this circumstance, we cannot judge whether the WCCC is satisfied at this order. In our investigation, the $k$th-order perturbation inequality is generally derived. Using the inequalities, we examine the WCCC for nearly extremal Reissner-Nordst\""{o}m black holes at higher-order approximation. It is shown that the WCCC cannot be violated yet after the perturbation. From this result, it can be indicated that the WCCC is strictly satisfied at the perturbation level for nearly extremal RN black holes. ",high energy physics theory
"  Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) allow physical signals to be processed using digital hardware. The power consumed in conversion grows with the sampling rate and quantization resolution, imposing a major challenge in power-limited systems. A common ADC architecture is based on sample-and-hold (S/H) circuits, where the analog signal is being tracked only for a fraction of the sampling period. In this paper, we propose the concept of eSampling ADCs, which harvest energy from the analog signal during the time periods where the signal is not being tracked. This harvested energy can be used to supplement the ADC itself, paving the way to the possibility of zero-power consumption and power-saving ADCs. We analyze the tradeoff between the ability to recover the sampled signal and the energy harvested, and provide guidelines for setting the sampling rate in the light of accuracy and energy constraints. Our analysis indicates that eSampling ADCs operating with up to 12 bits per sample can acquire bandlimited analog signals such that they can be perfectly recovered without requiring power from the external source. Furthermore, our theoretical results reveal that eSampling ADCs can in fact save power by harvesting more energy than they consume. To verify the feasibility of eSampling ADCs, we present a circuit-level design using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) 65 nm technology. An eSampling 8-bit ADC which samples at 40 MHZ is designed on a Cadence Virtuoso platform. Our experimental study involving Nyquist rate sampling of bandlimited signals demonstrates that such ADCs are indeed capable of harvesting more energy than that spent during analog-to-digital conversion, without affecting the accuracy.

The off-shell CHY integrals are chosen to be in the double-cover framework, thus, as a by product, our result also provides a verification for the double-cover construction.

"  We present a quantum algorithm to solve dynamic programming problems with convex value functions. For linear discrete-time systems with a $d$-dimensional state space of size $N$, the proposed algorithm outputs a quantum-mechanical representation of the value function in time $O(T \gamma^{dT}\mathrm{polylog}(N,(T/\varepsilon)^{d}))$, where $\varepsilon$ is the accuracy of the solution, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\gamma$ is a problem-specific parameter depending on the condition numbers of the cost functions. This allows us to evaluate the value function at any fixed state in time $O(T \gamma^{dT}\sqrt{N}\,\mathrm{polylog}(N,(T/\varepsilon)^{d}))$, and the corresponding optimal action can be recovered by solving a convex program. The class of optimization problems to which our algorithm can be applied includes provably hard stochastic dynamic programs. Finally, we show that the algorithm obtains a quadratic speedup (up to polylogarithmic factors) compared to the classical Bellman approach on some dynamic programs with continuous state space that have $\gamma=1$.

"  Semiclassical electrodynamics is an appealing approach for studying light-matter interactions, especially for realistic molecular systems. However, there is no unique semiclassical scheme. On the one hand, intermolecular interactions can be described instantaneously by static two-body interactions connecting different molecules plus a classical transverse E-field; we will call this Hamiltonian #I. On the other hand, intermolecular interactions can also be described as effects that are mediated exclusively through a classical one-body E-field without any quantum effects at all (assuming we ignore electronic exchange); we will call this Hamiltonian #II. Moreover, one can also mix these two Hamiltonians into a third, hybrid Hamiltonian, which preserves quantum electron-electron correlations for lower excitations but describes higher excitations in a mean-field way. To investigate which semiclassical scheme is most reliable for practical use, here we study the real-time dynamics of a pair of identical two-level systems (TLSs) undergoing either resonance energy transfer (RET) or collectively driven dynamics. While all approaches perform reasonably well when there is no strong external excitation, we find that no single approach is perfect for all conditions. Each method has its own distinct problems: Hamiltonian #I performs best for RET but behaves in a complicated manner for driven dynamics. Hamiltonian #II is always stable, but obviously fails for RET at short distances. One key finding is that, under externally driving, a full configuration interaction description of Hamiltonian #I strongly overestimates the long-time electronic energy, highlighting the not obvious fact that, if one plans to merge quantum molecules with classical light, a full, exact treatment of electron-electron correlations can actually lead to worse results than a simple mean-field treatment.

"  Correlation functions are widely used in extra-galactic astrophysics to extract insights into how galaxies occupy dark matter halos and in cosmology to place stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. A correlation function fundamentally requires computing pair-wise separations between two sets of points and then computing a histogram of the separations. Corrfunc is an existing open-source, high-performance software package for efficiently computing a multitude of correlation functions. In this paper, we will discuss the SIMD AVX512F kernels within Corrfunc, capable of processing 16 floats or 8 doubles at a time. The latest manually implemented Corrfunc AVX512F kernels show a speedup of up to $\sim 4\times$ relative to compiler-generated code for double-precision calculations. The AVX512F kernels show $\sim 1.6\times$ speedup relative to the AVX kernels and compare favorably to a theoretical maximum of $2\times$. In addition, by pruning pairs with too large of a minimum possible separation, we achieve a $\sim 5-10\%$ speedup across all the SIMD kernels. Such speedups highlight the importance of programming explicitly with SIMD vector intrinsics for complex calculations that can not be efficiently vectorized by compilers.

"  Binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) are expected to be a generic byproduct from hierarchical galaxy formation. The final coalescence of BSBHs is thought to be the loudest gravitational wave (GW) siren, yet no confirmed BSBH is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars have been proposed as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely uncertain. Here we report discovery of a periodicity (P=1607$\pm$7 days) at 99.95% significance (with a global p-value of ~$10^{-3}$ accounting for the look elsewhere effect) in the optical light curves of a redshift 1.53 quasar, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey data with new, sensitive imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20-yr time baseline spans ~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (restframe 1.7-yr) periodicity. The light curves are best fit by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion disks. The periodicity is likely caused by accretion rate modulation by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting GWs, dynamically coupled to the circumbinary accretion disk. A bursty hydrodynamic variability model is statistically preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic effect proposed for PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes disfavors Doppler boost, lending independent support to the circumbinary accretion variability hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH candidate from circumbinary accretion variability out of 625 quasars, it suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time may be able to detect hundreds to thousands of candidate BSBHs from circumbinary accretion with direct implications for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

"  In the graph signal processing (GSP) literature, it has been shown that signal-dependent graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) can efficiently promote piecewise constant (PWC) signal reconstruction for various image restoration tasks. However, for planar image patches, like total variation (TV), GLR may suffer from the well-known ""staircase"" effect. To remedy this problem, we generalize GLR to gradient graph Laplacian regularizer (GGLR) that provably promotes piecewise planar (PWP) signal reconstruction for the image interpolation problem -- a 2D grid with randomly missing pixels that requires completion. Specifically, we first construct two higher-order gradient graphs to connect local horizontal and vertical gradients. Each local gradient is estimated using structure tensor, which is robust using known pixels in a small neighborhood, mitigating the problem of larger noise variance when computing gradient of gradients. Moreover, unlike total generalized variation (TGV), GGLR retains the quadratic form of GLR, leading to an unconstrained quadratic programming (QP) problem per iteration that can be solved quickly using conjugate gradient (CG). We derive the means-square-error minimizing weight parameter for GGLR, trading off bias and variance of the signal estimate. Experiments show that GGLR outperformed competing schemes in interpolation quality for severely damaged images at a reduced complexity. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  A first-order gauge invariant formulation for the two-dimensional quantum rigid rotor is long known in the theoretical physics community as an isolated peculiar model. Parallel to that fact, the longstanding constraints abelianization problem, aiming at the conversion from second to first class systems for quantization purposes, has been approached a number of times in the literature with a handful of different forms and techniques and still continues to be a source of lively and interesting discussions. Connecting these two points, we develop a new systematic method for converting second class systems to first class ones, valid for a class of systems encompassing the quantum rigid rotor as a special case. In particular the gauge invariance of the quantum rigid rotor is fully clarified and generalized in the context of arbitrary translations along the radial momentum direction. Our method differs substantially from previous ones as it does not rely neither on the introduction of new auxiliary variables nor on the a priori interpretation of the second class constraints as coming from a gauge-fixing process.

"  Satellite-based solar irradiation forecasting is useful for short-term intra-day time horizons, outperforming numerical weather predictions up to 3-4 hours ahead. The main techniques for solar satellite forecast are based on sophisticated cloud motion estimates from geostationary satellite images. This work explores the use of satellite information in a simpler way, namely spatial averages that require almost no preprocessing. Adaptive auto-regressive models are used to assess the impact of this information on the forecasting performance. A complete analysis regarding model selection, the satellite averaging window size and the inclusion of satellite past measurements is provided. It is shown that: (i) satellite spatial averages are useful inputs and the averaging window size is an important parameter, (ii) satellite lags are of limited utility and spatial averages are more useful than weighted time averages, and (iii) there is no value in fine-tuning the orders of auto-regressive models for each time horizon, as the same performance can be obtained by using a fixed well-selected order. These ideas are tested for a region with intermediate solar variability, and the models succeed to outperform a proposed optimal smart persistence, used here as an exigent performance benchmark.

Although the T-duality rules are rather intricate, we find a certain redefinition of potentials which considerably simplifies the duality rules. After the redefinition, potentials are identified with components of the T-duality-covariant potentials, which have been predicted by the $E_{11}$ conjecture. We also discuss the field strengths of the mixed-symmetry potentials. ",high energy physics theory
"  We know that maximal efficiency in physical systems is attained by reversible processes. It is then interesting to see how irreversibility affects efficiency in other systems, e.g., in a city. In this study, we focus on a cyclic process of movements (home to workplace and back to home) in a city to investigate the above question. To this end, we present a minimal model of the movements, along with plausible definitions for the efficiency and irreversibility of the process; more precisely, we take the inverse of the total travel time per number of trips for efficiency and the relative entropy of the forward and backward flow distributions for the process irreversibility. We perform numerical simulations of the model for reasonable choices of the population distribution, the mobility law, and the movement strategy. The results show that the efficiency of movements is indeed negatively correlated with the above measure of irreversibility. The structure of the network and the impact of the flows on the travel times are the main factors here that affect the time intervals of arriving to destinations and returning to origins, which are usually larger than the time interval of the departures. This in turn gives rise to diverging of the backward flows from the forward ones and results to entropy (disorder or uncertainty) production in the system. The findings of this study might be helpful in characterizing more accurately the city efficiency and in better understanding of the main working principles of these complex systems. ",physics
"  In this study, we investigate the influences of fermionic $q$-deformation on the Einstein equations by taking into account of Verlinde's entropic gravity approach and Strominger's proposal on quantum black holes. According to Verlinde's proposal, gravity is interpreted as an entropic force. Moreover, Strominger's suggetion claims that extremal black holes obey deformed statistics instead of the standard Bose or Fermi statistics. Inspired by Verlinde's and Strominger's suggestions, we represent some thermostatistical functions of VPJC-type $q$-deformed fermion gas model for the high-temperature limit. Applying the Verlinde's entropic gravity approach to the $q$-deformed entropy function, $q$-deformed Einstein equations with the effective cosmological constant are derived. The results obtained in this work are compared with the related works in the literature. ",physics
"  Non-ideal MHD effects have been shown recently as a robust mechanism of averting the magnetic braking ""catastrophe"" and promoting protostellar disc formation. However, the magnetic diffusivities that determine the efficiency of non-ideal MHD effects are highly sensitive to microphysics. We carry out non-ideal MHD simulations to explore the role of microphysics on disc formation and the interplay between ambipolar diffusion (AD) and Hall effect during the protostellar collapse. We find that removing the smallest grain population ($\lesssim$10 nm) from the standard MRN size distribution is sufficient for enabling disc formation. Further varying the grain sizes can result in either a Hall-dominated or an AD-dominated collapse; both form discs of tens of AU in size regardless of the magnetic field polarity. The direction of disc rotation is bimodal in the Hall dominated collapse but unimodal in the AD-dominated collapse. We also find that AD and Hall effect can operate either with or against each other in both radial and azimuthal directions, yet the combined effect of AD and Hall is to move the magnetic field radially outward relative to the infalling envelope matter. In addition, microphysics and magnetic field polarity can leave profound imprints both on observables (e.g., outflow morphology, disc to stellar mass ratio) and on the magnetic field characteristics of protoplanetary discs. Including Hall effect relaxes the requirements on microphysics for disc formation, so that prestellar cores with cosmic-ray ionization rate of $\lesssim$2--3$\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ can still form small discs of $\lesssim$10 AU radius. We conclude that disc formation should be relatively common for typical prestellar core conditions, and that microphysics in the protostellar envelope is essential to not only disc formation, but also protoplanetary disc evolution.

"  Dissipative dynamical systems characterised by two basins of attraction are found in many physical systems, notably in hydrodynamics where laminar and turbulent regimes can coexist. The state space of such systems is structured around a dividing manifold called the edge, which separates trajectories attracted by the laminar state from those reaching the turbulent state. We apply here concepts and tools from Lagrangian data analysis to investigate this edge manifold. This approach is carried out in the state space of automous arbitrarily high-dimensional dissipative systems, in which the edge manifold is re-interpreted as a Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS). Two different diagnostics, finite-time Lyapunov exponents and Lagrangian Descriptors, are used and compared with respect to their ability to identify the edge and to their scalability. Their properties are illustrated on several low-order models of subcritical transition of increasing dimension and complexity, as well on well-resolved simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations in the case of plane Couette flow. They allow for a mapping of the global structure of both the state space and the edge manifold based on quantitative information. Both diagnostics can also be used to generate efficient bisection algorithms to approach asymptotic edge states, which outperform classical edge tracking. ",physics
"  In this survey we stress the importance of the higher transcendental Mittag-Leffler function in the framework of the Fractional Calculus. We first start with the analytical properties of the classical Mittag-Leffler function as derived from being the solution of the simplest fractional differential equation governing relaxation processes. Through the Sections of the text we plan to address the reader in this pathway towards the main applications of the Mittag-Leffler function that has induced us in the past to define it as the Queen Function of the Fractional Calculus.   These applications concern some noteworthy stochastic processes and the time fractional diffusion-wave equation. We expect that in the next future this function will gain more credit in the science of complex systems.   In Appendix A we sketch some historical aspects related to the author's acquaintance with this function. Finally, with respect to the published version in Entropy, we add Appendix B where we briefly refer to the numerical methods nowadays available to compute the functions of the Mittag-Leffler type.

In particular, we show how a field theory gives rise to an $L_\infty$-algebra and how quasi-isomorphisms between $L_\infty$-algebras correspond to classical equivalences of field theories. A few experts may be familiar with parts of our discussion, however, the material is presented from the perspective of a very general notion of a gauge theory. We also make a number of new observations and present some new results. Most importantly, we discuss in great detail higher (categorified) Chern-Simons theories and give some useful shortcuts in usually rather involved computations. ",high energy physics theory
"  Using the principles of the modern scattering amplitudes programme, we develop a formalism for constructing the amplitudes of three-dimensional topologically massive gauge theories and gravity. Inspired by recent developments in four dimensions, we construct the three-dimensional equivalent of $x$-variables for conserved matter currents coupled to topologically massive gauge bosons or gravitons. Using these, we bootstrap various matter-coupled gauge-theory and gravitational scattering amplitudes, and conjecture that topologically massive gauge theory and topologically massive gravity are related by the double copy. To motivate this idea further, we show explicitly that the Landau gauge propagator on the gauge theory side double copies to the de Donder gauge propagator on the gravity side.

"  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in the use of face masks worldwide. Face coverings can affect both acoustic properties of the signal as well as speech patterns and have unintended effects if the person wearing the mask attempts to use speech processing technologies. In this paper we explore the impact of wearing face masks on the automated assessment of English language proficiency. We use a dataset from a large-scale speaking test for which test-takers were required to wear face masks during the test administration, and we compare it to a matched control sample of test-takers who took the same test before the mask requirements were put in place. We find that the two samples differ across a range of acoustic measures and also show a small but significant difference in speech patterns. However, these differences do not lead to differences in human or automated scores of English language proficiency. Several measures of bias showed no differences in scores between the two groups.

"  We analyze the breakdown of causality for the perfect fluid limit in a medium with polarizeability. We show that to restore causality a relaxation term linking vorticity and polarization, analogous to the Israel-Stewart term linking viscous forces and gradients,is required. This term provides a minimum amount of dissipation a locally thermalized relativistic medium with polarizeability must have, independently of its underlying degrees of freedom. For ferromagnetic materials an infrared acausal mode remains, which we interpret as a Banks-Casher mode signaling spontaneous magnetization. With these ingredients, we propose a candidate for a fully causal Lagrangian of a relativistic polarizeable system near the perfect fluid limit. ",high energy physics theory

The results underscore the utility of the NED-D MEDs in bolstering the cosmic distance scale and facilitating the identification of systematic trends. ",astrophysics
"  This paper proposes a Decision Tree (DT) based detection and classification of internal faults in a power transformer. The faults are simulated in Power System Computer Aided Design (PSCAD)/ Electromagnetic Transients including DC (EMTDC) by varying the fault resistance, fault inception angle, and percentage of winding under fault. A series of features are extracted from the differential currents in phases a, b, and c belonging to the time, and frequency domains. Out of these, three features are selected to distinguish the internal faults from the magnetizing inrush and another three to classify faults in the primary and secondary of the transformer. DT, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boost (GB) classifiers are used to determine the fault types. The results show that DT detects faults with 100\% accuracy and the GB classifier performed the best among the three classifiers while classifying the internal faults.

We also prove that ideals having no proper reduction are big ideals, and maximal ideals in regular rings are big. ",mathematics
"  We propose a model for realizing frequency-dependent spatial variations of the probe susceptibility in a cold atomic sample. It is found that the usual Kramers-Kronig (KK) relation between real and imaginary parts of the probe susceptibility in the frequency domain can be mapped into the space domain as a far detuned control field of intensity linearly varied in space is used. This non-Hermitian medium exhibits then a unidirectional reflectionless frequency band for probe photons incident from either the left or the right sample end. It is of special interest that we can tune the frequency band as well as choose the direction corresponding to the vanishing reflectivity by changing, respectively, the control field intensity and frequency. The nonzero reflectivity from the other direction is typically small for realistic atomic densities, but can be largely enhanced by incorporating the Bragg scattering into the spatial KK relation so as to achieve a high reflectivity contrast.

"  We provide the first characterization of the nonlinear and time dependent rheologic response of viscoelastic bottom-up holographic models. More precisely, we perform oscillatory shear tests in holographic massive gravity theories with finite elastic response, focusing on the large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) regime. The characterization of these systems is done using several techniques: (I) the Lissajous figures, (II) the Fourier analysis of the stress signal, (III) the Pipkin diagram and (IV) the dependence of the storage and loss moduli on the amplitude of the applied strain. We find substantial evidence for a strong strain stiffening mechanism, typical of hyper-elastic materials such as rubbers and complex polymers. This indicates that the holographic models considered are not a good description for rigid metals, where strain stiffening is not commonly observed. Additionally, a crossover between a viscoelastic liquid regime at small graviton mass (compared to the temperature scale), and a viscoelastic solid regime at large values is observed. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for soft matter and for the understanding of the widely used homogeneous holographic models with broken translations. ",high energy physics theory
"  The next generation ground-based gravitational wave interferometers will possibly observe mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) and binary neutron stars (BNSs) to redshift $z\gtrsim{}10$ and $z\gtrsim{}2$, respectively. Here, we characterize the properties of merging BBHs, BNSs and neutron star-black hole binaries across cosmic time, by means of population-synthesis simulations combined with the Illustris cosmological simulation. We find that the mass of merging compact objects does not depend (or depends very mildly) on the merger redshift. Even the mass distribution of black holes depends only mildly on redshift, because BBHs originating from metal-poor progenitors ($Z\leq{}4\times{}10^{-3}$) dominate the entire population of merging BBHs across cosmic time. For a common-envelope efficiency $\alpha{}\ge{}3$, the main difference between the mass distribution of BBHs merging in the last Gyr and that of BBHs merging more than 11 Gyr ago is that there is an excess of heavy merging black holes ($20-35$ M$_\odot$) in the last Gyr. This excess is explained by the longer delay time of massive BBHs. ",astrophysics

"  Helium nanodroplets doped with polar molecules are studied by electrostatic deflection. This broadly applicable method allows even polyatomic molecules to attain sub-Kelvin temperatures and nearly full orientation in the field. The resulting intense force from the field gradient strongly deflects even droplets with tens of thousands of atoms, the most massive neutral systems studied by beam ""deflectometry."" We use the deflections to extract droplet size distributions. Moreover, since each host droplet deflects according to its mass, spatial filtering of the deflected beam translates into size filtering of neutral fragile nanodroplets. As an example, we measure the dopant ionization probability as a function of droplet radius and determine the mean free path for charge hopping through the helium matrix. The technique will enable separation of doped and neat nanodroplets and size-dependent spectroscopic studies. ",physics
"  A hot plasma is the dominant phase of the interstellar medium of early-type galaxies. Its origin can reside in stellar mass losses, residual gas from the formation epoch, and accretion from outside of the galaxies. Its evolution is linked to the dynamical structure of the host galaxy, to the supernova and AGN feedback, and to (late-epoch) star formation, in a way that has yet to be fully understood. Important clues about the origin and evolution of the hot gas come from the abundances of heavy metals, that have been studied with increasing detail with XMM-Newton and Chandra. We present recent high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of the hot gas evolution that include the above processes, and where several chemical species, originating in AGB stars and supernovae of type Ia and II, have also been considered. The high resolution, of few parsecs in the central galactic region, allows us to track the metal enrichment, transportation and dilution throughout the galaxy. The comparison of model results with observed abundances reveals a good agreement for the region enriched by the AGN wind, but also discrepancies for the diffuse hot gas; the latter indicate the need for a revision of standard assumptions, and/or the importance of neglected effects as those due to the dust, and/or residual uncertainties in deriving abundances from the X-ray spectra.

The data simulated from the generator are then passed to a neural network model which we base only on the partial knowledge of the generator. We aim to see if the interpretation of the generated data can provide the probability distributions of basic processes of such a physical system. This way, some of the information we omitted from the network model on purpose is recovered. We believe this approach can be beneficial in the analysis of real QCD processes. ",physics
"  Human migration during the Chinese Spring Festival (SF) is the largest collective human activity of its kind in the modern era-involving about one-tenth of the world population and over six percent of the earth's land surface area. The festival results in a drop of air pollutant emissions that causes dramatic changes of atmospheric composition over China's most polluted regions. Based on satellite and in-situ measurements for the years 2005-2019 over 50 cities in eastern China, we find that the atmospheric NO2 pollution dropped by ~40% during the SF week, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) decreased by ~30% in the following week, reflecting the effectiveness of precursor emission controls on the mitigation of secondary PM2.5 formation. However, although human activity and emissions are at the lowest level, air pollution over eastern China during the SF still far exceeds that over other worldwide pollution hotspots. Our analyses suggest that measures based solely on end-of-pipe controls and industry upgrades may not suffice to meet air quality goals. Further cleaning of the air in China depends fundamentally on sustainable advances in both heavy industry upgrades and clean energy transition. ",physics

For such bottom relief, several new KdV-type wave equations are derived. These equations generalize the KdV, the extended KdV (KdV2), the fifth-order KdV (KdV5) and the Gardner equations. ",physics
"  Sparse array (SA) geometries, such as coprime and nested arrays, can be regarded as a concatenation of two uniform linear arrays (ULAs). Such arrays lead to a significant increase of the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) when the second-order information is utilized, i.e., they provide long virtual difference coarray (DCA). Thus, the idea of this paper is based on the observation that SAs can be fitted through concatenation of sub-ULAs. A corresponding SA design principle, called ULA fitting, is then proposed. It aims to design SAs from sub-ULAs. Towards this goal, a polynomial model for arrays is used, and based on it, a DCA structure is analyzed if SA is composed of multiple sub-ULAs. SA design with low mutual coupling is considered. ULA fitting enables to transfer the SA design requirements, such as hole free, low mutual coupling and other requirements, into pseudo polynomial equation, and hence, find particular solutions. We mainly focus on designing SAs with low mutual coupling and large uniform DOF. Two examples of SAs with closed-form expressions are then developed based on ULA fitting. Numerical experiments verify the superiority of the proposed SAs in the presence of heavy mutual coupling. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  The method of topological renormalization in anti-de Sitter (AdS) gravity consists in adding to the action a topological term which renders it finite, defining at the same time a well-posed variational problem. Here, we use this prescription to work out the thermodynamics of asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter (AlAdS) spacetimes, focusing on the physical properties of the Misner strings of both the Taub-NUT-AdS and Taub-Bolt-AdS solutions. We compute the contribution of the Misner string to the entropy by treating on the same footing the AdS and AlAdS sectors. As topological renormalization is found to correctly account for the physical quantities in the parity preserving sector of the theory, we then investigate the holographic consequences of adding also the Chern-Pontryagin topological invariant to the bulk action; in particular, we discuss the emergence of the parity-odd contribution in the boundary stress tensor.

"  This paper presents a re-formulation of the boundary integral method (BIM) for the Debye-Huckel model of molecular and colloidal electrostatics that removes the mathematical singularities that have been accepted as an intrinsic part of the conventional BIM. The essence of the present boundary regularized integral equation formulation consists of subtracting a known solution from the conventional BIM in such a way as to cancel out the singularities associated with the Green's function. This approach better reflects the non-singular physical behavior of the systems on boundaries with the benefits of (i) the surface integrals can be evaluated accurately using quadrature without any need to devise special numerical integration procedures, (ii) being able to use quadratic or spline function surface elements to represent the surface more accurately and the variation of the functions within each element is represented to a consistent level of precision by appropriate interpolation functions, (iii) being able to calculate electric fields, even at boundaries, accurately and directly from the potential without having to solve hypersingular integral equations and this imparts high precision in calculating the Maxwell stress tensor and consequently, intermolecular or colloidal forces, (iv) a reliable way to handle geometric configurations in which different parts of the boundary can be very close together without being affected by numerical instabilities, therefore potentials, fields and forces between surfaces can be found accurately at surface separations down to near contact, and (v) having the simplicity of a formulation that does not require complex algorithms to handle singularities will result in significant savings in coding effort and in the reduction of opportunities for coding errors.

"  The modal decomposition techniques of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have become a common method for analysing the spatio-temporal coherence of dynamical systems. In particular, these techniques are of interest for liquid injection systems due to the inherent complexity of multiphase interactions and extracting the underlying flow processes is desired. Although numerous works investigating flow processes have implemented POD and DMD, the results are often highly interpretive with limited link between the decomposition theory and the interpreted physical meaning of the extracted modes. Here, we provide insight into the interpretation of POD and DMD modes in a hierarchical structure. The interpretation of modes for simple canonical systems is validated through knowledge of the underlying processes which dominate the systems. We show that modes which capture true underlying phenomena produce subsequent modes at higher harmonics, up until the Nyquist limit, whose modal structure scales decrease proportionally with increasing modal frequency. These higher harmonics primarily encode motion information and may or may not capture additional structural information, which is dependent on the system. We demonstrate these findings first on canonical liquid injection systems to enhance the interpretation and understanding of results extracted from practical jet in crossflow systems. ",physics

In this way the light emitted by different LED can be separated well from each other then minimize signal interference. However, interference increases in the case of system deviation, so we explore the system mobility. Then subsequent signal processing is carried out, including signal combining and successive interference cancellation (SIC). We combine the same signal received by different receivers to improve signal to interference noise ratio (SINR). And SIC can effectively restore interference and eliminate its impact. The simulation results show that channel capacity can be increased by more than 5 times and up to 20 times under the condition of receiver and transmitter alignment. In the case of movement, channel capacity can also be increased by about 4 times on average. Moreover, the mobile range of system is also significantly expanded.

"  Bright, short radio bursts are emitted by sources at a large range of distances: from the nearby Crab pulsar to remote Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). FRBs are likely to originate from distant neutron stars, but our knowledge of the radio pulsar population has been limited to the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.

For direct comparison we also present a LOFAR study on the low-frequency giant pulses from the Crab pulsar; their fluence distribution follows a power law with slope 3.04(3). A number of candidate signals were detected from M31 but none proved persistent. FRBs are sometimes thought of as Crab-like pulsars with exceedingly bright giant pulses -- given our sensitivity, we can rule out that M31 hosts pulsars more than an order of magnitude brighter than the Crab pulsar, assuming their pulse scattering follows that of the known FRBs.

"  We extend previous work on the numerical diagonalization of quantum stress tensor operators in the Minkowski vacuum state, which considered operators averaged in a finite time interval, to operators averaged in a finite spacetime region. Since real experiments occur over finite volumes and durations, physically meaningful fluctuations may be obtained from stress tensor operators averaged by compactly supported sampling functions in space and time. The direct diagonalization, via a Bogoliubov transformation, gives the eigenvalues and the probabilities of measuring those eigenvalues in the vacuum state, from which the underlying probability distribution can be constructed. For the normal-ordered square of the time derivative of a massless scalar field in a spherical cavity with finite degrees of freedom, analysis of the tails of these distributions confirms previous results based on the analytical treatment of the high moments. We find that the probability of large vacuum fluctuations is reduced when spatial averaging is included, but the tail still decreases more slowly than exponentially as the magnitude of the measured eigenvalues increases, suggesting vacuum fluctuations may not always be subdominant to thermal fluctuations and opening up the possibility of experimental observation under the right conditions.

"  Analytical solutions in fluid dynamics can be used to elucidate the physics of complex flows and to serve as test cases for numerical models. In this work, we present the analytical solution for the acoustic boundary layer that develops around a rigid sphere executing small amplitude harmonic rectilinear motion in a compressible fluid. The mathematical framework that describes the primary flow is identical to that of wave propagation in linearly elastic solids, the difference being the appearance of complex instead of real valued wave numbers. The solution reverts to well-known classical solutions in special limits: the potential flow solution in the thin boundary layer limit, the oscillatory flat plate solution in the limit of large sphere radius and the Stokes flow solutions in the incompressible limit of infinite sound speed. As a companion analytical result, the steady second order acoustic streaming flow is obtained. This streaming flow is driven by the Reynolds stress tensor that arises from the axisymmetric first order primary flow around such a rigid sphere. These results are obtained with a linearization of the non-linear Navier-Stokes equations valid for small amplitude oscillations of the sphere. The streaming flow obeys a time-averaged Stokes equation with a body force given by the Nyborg model in which the above mentioned primary flow in a compressible Newtonian fluid is used to estimate the time-averaged body force. Numerical results are presented to explore different regimes of the complex transverse and longitudinal wave numbers that characterize the primary flow. ",physics

"  X-ray images may present non-trivial features with predictive information of patients that develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. If true, this hypothesis may have practical value in allocating resources to particular patients while using a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty of testing such a hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data, which need to be well-annotated and should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome. This paper presents an original methodology for extracting semantic features that correlate to severity from a data set with patient ICU admission labels through interpretable models. The methodology employs a neural network trained to recognise lung pathologies to extract the semantic features, which are then analysed with low-complexity models to limit overfitting while increasing interpretability. This analysis points out that only a few features explain most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms. When applied to an unrelated larger data set with pathology-related clinical notes, the method has shown to be capable of selecting images for the learned features, which could translate some information about their common locations in the lung. Besides attesting separability on patients that eventually develop severe symptoms, the proposed methods represent a statistical approach highlighting the importance of features related to ICU admission that may have been only qualitatively reported. While handling limited data sets, notable methodological aspects are adopted, such as presenting a state-of-the-art lung segmentation network and the use of low-complexity models to avoid overfitting. The code for methodology and experiments is also available. ",electrical engineering and systems science
"  Medical imaging systems are commonly assessed and optimized by use of objective measures of image quality (IQ). The Ideal Observer (IO) performance has been advocated to provide a figure-of-merit for use in assessing and optimizing imaging systems because the IO sets an upper performance limit among all observers. When joint signal detection and localization tasks are considered, the IO that employs a modified generalized likelihood ratio test maximizes observer performance as characterized by the localization receiver operating characteristic (LROC) curve. Computations of likelihood ratios are analytically intractable in the majority of cases. Therefore, sampling-based methods that employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been developed to approximate the likelihood ratios. However, the applications of MCMC methods have been limited to relatively simple object models. Supervised learning-based methods that employ convolutional neural networks have been recently developed to approximate the IO for binary signal detection tasks. In this paper, the ability of supervised learning-based methods to approximate the IO for joint signal detection and localization tasks is explored. Both background-known-exactly and background-known-statistically signal detection and localization tasks are considered. The considered object models include a lumpy object model and a clustered lumpy model, and the considered measurement noise models include Laplacian noise, Gaussian noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. The LROC curves produced by the supervised learning-based method are compared to those produced by the MCMC approach or analytical computation when feasible.

One such exciting possibility is cannibalistic dark matter (CanDM), which has exothermal number-changing interactions allowing it to stay warm far into its non-relativistic regime. Here we investigate the cosmological implications of CanDM and how it impacts CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum, by implementing the model within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver. We show that CanDM suppresses the small scale matter power spectrum in a way very similar to light Warm Dark Matter or Hot Dark Matter. However, unlike in those models, the suppression may happen while the CanDM model still remains compatible with CMB constraints. We put strong constraints on the interaction strength of CanDM as a function of its abundance for both constant and temperature-dependent thermally-averaged cross sections. We find that the CanDM model can easily solve the $S_8$ tension (but has no impact on the Hubble tension). Indeed, it can accommodate values of $S_8$ of the order of 0.76 while being compatible with CMB+BAO data. However, as long as the $S_8$ tension remains moderate, the overall $\chi^2$ improvement is relatively small given the number of extra free parameters, and the CanDM model is not significantly preferred.

"  We present a non-supersymmetric deformation of probe branes describing conformal defects of codimension two in AdS/CFT. The worldvolume of the probe branes is deformed from $AdS_{p}\times S^1$ embedded in an $AdS_{p+2} \times \mathcal M^{D-p-2}$ background to an embedding of Janus form, which uses an $AdS_{p-1}$ slicing of $AdS_p$ and in which the brane bends along the slicing coordinate. In field theory terms this realizes conformal interfaces on codimension-two defects. We discuss these ""Janus on the brane"" solutions for $AdS_3\times S^1$ D3-branes in the $AdS_5\times S^5$ solution of Type IIB, realizing interfaces on surface defects in $\mathcal N=4$ SYM, and show that similar solutions exist for probe branes in $AdS_{p+2}\times S^{9-p}$ vacua of M-theory and in the $AdS_6\times S^4$ solution of massive Type IIA.

We show that, for $\ell$ large enough (depending on the Shimura datum $(G,X)$ and the subvariety), such image contains the $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-points coming from the simply connected cover of the derived subgroup of $G$. This can be regarded as a geometric version of the integral $\ell$-adic Mumford-Tate conjecture. ",mathematics
"  The last two decades have seen an explosive growth in the theory and practice of both quantum computing and machine learning. Modern machine learning systems process huge volumes of data and demand massive computational power. As silicon semiconductor miniaturization approaches its physics limits, quantum computing is increasingly being considered to cater to these computational needs in the future. Small-scale quantum computers and quantum annealers have been built and are already being sold commercially. Quantum computers can benefit machine learning research and application across all science and engineering domains. However, owing to its roots in quantum mechanics, research in this field has so far been confined within the purview of the physics community, and most work is not easily accessible to researchers from other disciplines. In this paper, we provide a background and summarize key results of quantum computing before exploring its application to supervised machine learning problems. By eschewing results from physics that have little bearing on quantum computation, we hope to make this introduction accessible to data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and researchers from across disciplines.

"  Quantum compiling aims to construct a quantum circuit V by quantum gates drawn from a native gate alphabet, which is functionally equivalent to the target unitary U. It is a crucial stage for the running of quantum algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, the space for structure exploration of quantum circuit is enormous, resulting in the requirement of human expertise, hundreds of experimentations or modifications from existing quantum circuits. In this paper, we propose a variational quantum compiling (VQC) algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL), in order to automatically design the structure of quantum circuit for VQC with no human intervention. An agent is trained to sequentially select quantum gates from the native gate alphabet and the qubits they act on by double Q-learning with \epsilon-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. At first, the agent randomly explores a number of quantum circuits with different structures, and then iteratively discovers structures with higher performance on the learning task. Simulation results show that the proposed method can make exact compilations with less quantum gates compared to previous VQC algorithms. It can reduce the errors of quantum algorithms due to decoherence process and gate noise in NISQ devices, and enable quantum algorithms especially for complex algorithms to be executed within coherence time.

"  We present mid-infrared photometry and measured global properties of the 100 largest galaxies in the sky, including the Magellanic Clouds, Local Group galaxies M31 and M33, the Fornax and Virgo Galaxy Cluster giants, and many of the most spectacular Messier objects (e.g., M51 and M83). This is the first release of a larger catalog of extended sources as imaged in the mid-infrared, called the WISE Extended Source Catalogue (WXSC). In this study we measure their global attributes, including integrated flux, surface brightness and radial distribution. The largest of the large are the LMC, SMC and the Andromeda Galaxy, which are also the brightest mid-infrared galaxies in the sky. We interrogate the large galaxies using WISE colors, which serve as proxies for four general types of galaxies: bulge-dominated spheroidals, intermediate semi-quiescent disks, star-forming spirals, and AGN-dominated. The colors reveal a tight ""sequence"" that spans 5 magnitudes in W2-W3 color, ranging from early to late-types, and low to high star-forming activity; we fit the functional form given by: ${\rm (W1-W2)} = [0.015 \times {\rm e}^{ \frac{{\rm (W2-W3)}}{1.38} }] - 0.08$. Departures from this sequence may reveal nuclear, starburst, and merging events. Physical properties and luminosity attributes are computed, notably the diameter, aggregate stellar mass and the dust-obscured star formation activity. We introduce the 'pinwheel' diagram which depicts physical properties with respect to the median value observed for WISE galaxies in the local universe. Utilized with the WXSC, this diagram will delineate between different kinds of galaxies, identifying those with similar star formation and structural properties.

We refine our earlier estimates of shock parameters that were based upon ground-based spectra, including ram pressure, vorticity and magnetic field strength. We apply several techniques, including Fourier power spectra and the Rolling Hough Transform, to quantify the shape of the rippled shock front as viewed in different emission lines.

"  In a universe with quintessence isocurvature, or perturbations in dark energy that are independent from the usual curvature perturbations, structure formation is changed qualitatively. The existence of two independent fields, curvature and isocurvature, causes the growth rate of matter perturbations to depend on their initial conditions. The quintessence perturbations cause their growth to depend on scale. We perform the first separate universe simulations for this cosmology. We demonstrate that the power spectrum response and the halo bias depend on scale and initial conditions and that the presence of the isocurvature mode changes the mapping from these quantities to the halo auto- and cross-power spectra, and the squeezed-limit bispectrum. We compare the bias to several models, finding reasonable agreement with both a power-spectrum-response model with one free parameter and a model that fits two independent bias parameters for curvature and isocurvature sourced fluctuations. We also verify that simulation responses to pure isocurvature and pure curvature modes can be linearly combined to reproduce responses with different ratios of isocurvature and curvature. This allows our results to be used to predict the halo power spectrum and stochasticity with arbitrary large-scale curvature and isocurvature power spectra. In an appendix, we study the generation of quintessence isocurvature during inflation and show that a modified kinetic term is typically required to produce observable isocurvature modes in a field with $w_Q\approx -1$.

"  We use semi-analytic galaxy catalogs based on two high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations, Millennium-WMAP7 and Millennium-II, to investigate the formation of the Local Group (LG) analogs. Unlike previous studies, we use the observed stellar masses to select the LG member (Milky Way (MW) and M31) analogs, and then impose constrains using the observed separation, isolation, and kinematics of the two main member galaxies. By comparing radial and low-ellipticity orbits between the MW and M31, we find higher tangential velocity results in higher total mass, which are 4.4$^{+2.4}_{-1.5}\times$10$^{12}\rm M_{\odot}$ and 6.6$^{+2.7}_{-1.5}\times$10$^{12}\rm M_{\odot}$ for radial and low-ellipticity orbits. The orbits also influence the individual mass distribution of MW and M31 analogs. For radial orbits, the typical host halo masses of the MW and M31 are 1.5$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}\times$10$^{12}\rm M_{\odot}$ and 2.5$^{+1.3}_{-1.1}\times$10$^{12}\rm M_{\odot}$; for low-ellipticity orbits, the masses are 2.5$^{+2.2}_{-1.4}\times$10$^{12}\rm M_{\odot}$ and 3.8$^{+2.8}_{-1.8}\times$10$^{12} \rm M_{\odot}$. The LG is located primarily in filaments with tails extending toward higher densities up to $\delta\sim4.5$. The dark matter velocity anisotropy parameters $\beta$ of both the MW and M31 analogs are close to zero in the center, increasing to 0.2--0.3 at 50--80 kpc and decreasing slowly outward. The slope is much flatter than computed from the MW satellites, and the amplitude is smaller than traced by halo stars. Values of $\beta$ from different tracers agree at $\sim$120 kpc where $\beta \sim$ 0.2. We also find that model predictions agree broadly with observations in the radial distribution and luminosity function of satellites around the MW and M31. ",astrophysics

"  We present the UNIT $N$-body cosmological simulations project, designed to provide precise predictions for nonlinear statistics of the galaxy distribution. We focus on characterizing statistics relevant to emission line and luminous red galaxies in the current and upcoming generation of galaxy surveys.

We find that both two- and three-point statistics are unbiased. Over the scales of interest for baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, we find that the variance is greatly reduced in the two-point statistics and in the cross correlation between halos and cosmic voids, but is not reduced significantly for the three-point statistics. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the two-point correlation function for a galaxy survey with effective volume of 20 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ is improved by about a factor of 40, indicating that two pairs of simulations with a volume of 1 ($h^{-1}$Gpc)$^3$ lead to the equivalent variance of $\sim$150 such simulations. The $N$-body simulations presented here thus provide an effective survey volume of about seven times the effective survey volume of DESI or Euclid.

"  Globular clusters contain a finite number of stars. As a result, they inevitably undergo secular evolution (`relaxation') causing their mean distribution function (DF) to evolve on long timescales. On one hand, this long-term evolution may be interpreted as driven by the accumulation of local deflections along each star's mean field trajectory -- so-called `non-resonant relaxation'. On the other hand, it can be thought of as driven by non-local, collectively dressed and resonant couplings between stellar orbits, a process termed `resonant relaxation'. In this paper we consider a model globular cluster represented by a spherical, isotropic isochrone DF, and compare in detail the predictions of both resonant and non-resonant relaxation theories against tailored direct $N$-body simulations. In the space of orbital actions (namely the radial action and total angular momentum), we find that both resonant and non-resonant theories predict the correct morphology for the secular evolution of the cluster's DF, although non-resonant theory over-estimates the amplitude of the relaxation rate by a factor ${\sim 2}$. We conclude that the secular relaxation of hot isotropic spherical clusters is not dominated by collectively amplified large-scale potential fluctuations, despite the existence of a strong ${\ell = 1}$ damped mode. Instead, collective amplification affects relaxation only marginally even on the largest scales. The predicted contributions to relaxation from smaller scale fluctuations are essentially the same from resonant and non-resonant theories. ",astrophysics
"  This work presents a method for designing the weighting parameter required by Wiener-based binaural noise reduction methods. This parameter establishes the desired tradeoff between noise reduction and binaural cue preservation in hearing aid applications. The proposed strategy was specially derived for the preservation of interaural level difference, interaural time difference and interaural coherence binaural cues. It is defined as a function of the average input noise power at the microphones, providing robustness against the influence of joint changes in noise and speech power (Lombard effect), as well as to signal to noise ratio (SNR) variations. A theoretical framework, based on the mathematical definition of the homogeneity degree, is presented and applied to a generic augmented Wiener-based cost function. The theoretical insights obtained are supported bycomputational simulations and psychoacoustic experiments using the multichannel Wiener filter with interaural transfer function preservation technique (MWF-ITF), as a case study. Statistical analysis indicates that the proposed dynamic structure for the weighting parameter and the design method of its fixed part provide significant robustness against changes in the original binaural cues of both speech and residual noise, at the cost of a small decrease in the noise reduction performance, as compared to the use of a purely fixed weighting parameter.

We find a kind of universal near singularity behaviour independent of the dilaton potential, giving universal interrelations between the exponents defining the time behaviour near the cosmological singularity.

"  Convective self-aggregation is a modelling paradigm for thunderstorm organisation over a constant-temperature tropical sea surface. This setup can give rise to cloud clusters over timescales of weeks. In reality, sea surface temperatures do oscillate diurnally, affecting the atmospheric state. Over land, surface temperatures vary more strongly, and rain rate is significantly influenced. Here, we carry out a substantial suite of cloud-resolving numerical experiments, and find that even weak surface temperature oscillations enable qualitatively different dynamics to emerge: the spatial distribution of rainfall is only homogeneous during the first day. Already on the second day, the rain field is firmly structured. In later days, the clustering becomes stronger and alternates from day-to-day. We show that these features are robust to changes in resolution, domain size, and surface temperature, but can be removed by a reduction of the amplitude of oscillation, suggesting a transition to a clustered state. Maximal clustering occurs at a scale of $\mathbf{l_{max}\approx 180\;km}$, a scale we relate to the emergence of mesoscale convective systems. At $\mathbf{l_{max}}$ rainfall is strongly enhanced and far exceeds the rainfall expected at random. We explain the transition to clustering using simple conceptual modelling. Our results may help clarify how continental extremes build up and how cloud clustering over the tropical ocean could emerge much faster than through conventional self-aggregation alone. ",physics
"  The Seidel maps are two maps associated to a Hamiltonian circle action on a convex symplectic manifold, one on Floer cohomology and one on quantum cohomology. We extend their definitions to $S^1$-equivariant Floer cohomology and $S^1$-equivariant quantum cohomology based on a construction of Maulik and Okounkov. The $S^1$-action used to construct $S^1$-equivariant Floer cohomology changes after applying the equivariant Seidel map (a similar phenomenon occurs for $S^1$-equivariant quantum cohomology). We show the equivariant Seidel map on $S^1$-equivariant quantum cohomology does not commute with the $S^1$-equivariant quantum product, unlike the standard Seidel map. We prove an intertwining relation which completely describes the failure of this commutativity as a weighted version of the equivariant Seidel map. We will explore how this intertwining relationship may be interpreted using connections in an upcoming paper. We compute the equivariant Seidel map for rotation actions on the complex plane and on complex projective space, and for the action which rotates the fibres of the tautological line bundle over projective space. Through these examples, we demonstrate how equivariant Seidel maps may be used to compute the $S^1$-equivariant quantum product and $S^1$-equivariant symplectic cohomology. ",mathematics

"  Source localization based on electroencephalography (EEG) has become a widely used neuroimagining technique. However its precision has been shown to be very dependent on how accurately the brain, head and scalp can be electrically modeled within the so-called forward problem. The construction of this model is traditionally performed by leveraging Finite Element or Boundary Element Methods (FEM or BEM). Even though the latter is more computationally efficient thanks to the smaller interaction matrices it yields and near-linear solvers, it has traditionally been used on simpler models than the former. Indeed, while FEM models taking into account the different media anisotropies are widely available, BEM models have been limited to isotropic, piecewise homogeneous models. In this work we introduce a new BEM scheme taking into account the anisotropies of the white matter. The boundary nature of the formulation allows for an efficient discretization and modelling of the fibrous nature of the white matter as one-dimensional basis functions, limiting the computational impact of their modelling. We compare our scheme against widely used formulations and establish its correctness in both canonical and realistic cases. ",physics
"  The concept of a Sheffer operation known for Boolean algebras and orthomodular lattices is extended to arbitrary directed relational systems with involution. It is proved that to every such relational system there can be assigned a Sheffer groupoid and also, conversely, every Sheffer groupoid induces a directed relational system with involution. Hence, investigations of these relational systems can be transformed to the treaty of special groupoids which form a variety of algebras. If the Sheffer operation is also commutative then the induced binary relation is antisymmetric. Moreover, commutative Sheffer groupoids form a congruence distributive variety. We characterize symmertry, antisymmetry and treansitivity of binary relations by identities and quasi-identities satisfied by an assigned Sheffer operation. The concepts of twist-products of relational systems and of Kleene relational systems are introduced. We prove that every directed relational system can be embedded into a directed relational system with involution via the twist-product construction. If the relation in question is even transitive, then the directed relational system can be embedded into a Kleene relational system. Any Sheffer operation assigned to a directed relational system A with involution induces a Sheffer operation assigned to the twist-product of A. ",mathematics

"  We generalize the recently discovered relationship between JT gravity and double-scaled random matrix theory to the case that the boundary theory may have time-reversal symmetry and may have fermions with or without supersymmetry. The matching between variants of JT gravity and matrix ensembles depends on the assumed symmetries. Time-reversal symmetry in the boundary theory means that unorientable spacetimes must be considered in the bulk. In such a case, the partition function of JT gravity is still related to the volume of the moduli space of conformal structures, but this volume has a quantum correction and has to be computed using Reidemeister-Ray-Singer ""torsion."" Presence of fermions in the boundary theory (and thus a symmetry $(-1)^F$) means that the bulk has a spin or pin structure. Supersymmetry in the boundary means that the bulk theory is associated to JT supergravity and is related to the volume of the moduli space of super Riemann surfaces rather than of ordinary Riemann surfaces. In all cases we match JT gravity or supergravity with an appropriate random matrix ensemble. All ten standard random matrix ensembles make an appearance -- the three Dyson ensembles and the seven Altland-Zirnbauer ensembles. To facilitate the analysis, we extend to the other ensembles techniques that are most familiar in the case of the original Wigner-Dyson ensemble of hermitian matrices. We also generalize Mirzakhani's recursion for the volumes of ordinary moduli space to the case of super Riemann surfaces. ",high energy physics theory
"  We present a general method to derive the appropriate Darmois-Israel junction conditions for gravitational theories with higher-order derivative terms by integrating the bulk equations of motion across the singular hypersurface. In higher derivative theories, the field equations can contain terms which are more singular than the Dirac delta distribution. To handle them appropriately, we formulate a regularization procedure based on representing the delta function as the limit of a sequence of classical functions. This procedure involves imposing suitable constraints on the extrinsic curvature such that the field equations are compatible with the singular source being a delta distribution. As explicit examples of our approach, we demonstrate in detail how to obtain the generalized junction conditions for quadratic gravity, $\mathcal{F}(R)$ theories, a 4D low-energy effective action in string theory and action terms that are Euler densities. Our results are novel, and refine the accuracy of previously claimed results in $\mathcal{F} (R)$ theories and quadratic gravity. In particular, when the coupling constants of quadratic gravity are those for the Gauss-Bonnet case, our junction conditions reduce to the known ones for the latter obtained independently by boundary variation of a surface term in the action. Finally, we briefly discuss a couple of applications to thin-shell wormholes and stellar models. ",high energy physics theory

Here, we show an unprecedented de-carbonization of China's power system in late 2020: although China's power related carbon emissions were 0.5% higher in 2020 than 2019, the majority (92.9%) of the increased power demand was met by increases in low-carbon (renewables and nuclear) generation (increased by 9.3%), as compared to only 0.4% increase for fossil fuels. China's low-carbon generation in the country grew in the second half of 2020, supplying a record high of 36.7% (increased by 1.9% compared to 2019) of total electricity in 2020, when the fossil production dropped to a historical low of 63.3%. Combined, the carbon intensity of China's power sector decreased to an historical low of 519.9 tCO2/GWh in 2020. If the fast decarbonization and slowed down power demand growth from 2019 to 2020 were to continue, by 2030, over half (50.8%) of China's power demand could be provided by low carbon sources. Our results thus reveal that China made progress towards its carbon neutrality target during the pandemic, and suggest the potential for substantial further decarbonization in the next few years if the latest trends persist.

"  Hybrid lead halide perovskites with 2D stacking structures have recently emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications. We report a method for growing 2D nanosheets of hybrid lead halide perovskites (I, Br and Cl), with tunable lateral sizes ranging from 0.05 to 8 microns, and a structure consisting of n stacked monolayers separated by long alkylamines, tunable from bulk down to n=1. The key to obtaining such a wide range of perovskite properties hinged on utilizing the respective lead halide nanosheets as precursors in a hot-injection synthesis that afforded careful control over all process parameters. The layered, quantum confined (n small than 4) nanosheets were comprised of major and minor fractions with differing n. Energy funneling from low to high n (high to low energy) regions within a single sheet, mediated by the length of the ligands between stacks, produced photoluminescent quantum yields as high as 49 percent. These large, tunable 2D nanosheets could serve as convenient platforms for future high efficiency optoelectronic devices. ",physics
"  The skyrmion, which is characterised by a topological integer, is a structure that is topologically stable against local disturbances. The huge potential of skyrmions for use in magnetic storage systems has drawn considerable research interest among physicists. Recently, the optical skyrmion was discovered and has some excellent properties. However, these optical skyrmions have been observed, for example, in surface plasmons that consist of evanescent waves. This type of optical skyrmion is difficult to manipulate and also difficult to apply in practice. In this work, we realise several skyrmionic optical structures with different skyrmion numbers in a free-space linear optical system. Because of the convenience of operation using free-space optics, with the exception of the original applications of skyrmions, skyrmionic optical structures can also be applied widely, e.g. to enable manipulation of tiny objects or propagation over long distances.

"  The ESA PLATO space mission is devoted to unveiling and characterizing new extrasolar planets and their host stars. This mission will encompass a very large field of view, granting it the potential to survey up to one million stars depending on the final observation strategy. The telemetry budget of the spacecraft cannot handle transmitting individual images for such a huge stellar sample at the right cadence, so the development of an appropriate strategy to perform on-board data reduction is mandatory. We employ aperture photometry to produce stellar light curves in flight. Our aim is thus to find the mask model that optimizes the scientific performance of the reduced data. We considered three distinct aperture models: binary mask, weighted Gaussian mask, and weighted gradient mask giving lowest noise-to-signal ratio, computed through a novel direct method. An innovative criterion was adopted for choosing between different mask models. We designated as optimal the model providing the best compromise between sensitivity to detect true and false planet transits. We determined the optimal model based on simulated noise-to-signal ratio and frequency of threshold crossing events. Our results show that, although the binary mask statistically presents a few percent higher noise-to-signal ratio compared to weighted masks, both strategies have very similar efficiency in detecting legitimate planet transits. When it comes to avoiding spurious signals from contaminant stars however the binary mask statistically collects considerably less contaminant flux than weighted masks, thereby allowing the former to deliver up to $\sim$30\% less false transit signatures at $7.1\sigma$. Our proposed approach for choosing apertures has been proven to be decisive for the determination of a mask model capable to provide near maximum planet yield and substantially reduced occurrence of false positives.

"  Because of the complex physics that governs the formation of chromospheric lines, interpretation of solar chromospheric observations is difficult. The origin and characteristics of many chromospheric features are, because of this, unresolved. We focus here on studying two prominent features: long fibrils and flare ribbons. To model them, we use a 3D MHD simulation of an active region which self-consistently reproduces both of them. We model the H$\alpha$, Mg II k, Ca II K, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines using the 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code Multi3D.   This simulation reproduces long fibrils that span between the opposite-polarity sunspots and go up to 4 Mm in height. They can be traced in all lines due to density corrugation. Opposite to previous studies, H$\alpha$, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K, are formed at similar height in this model. Magnetic field lines are aligned with the H$\alpha$ fibrils, but the latter holds to a lesser extent for the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line.   The simulation shows structures in the H$\alpha$ line core that look like flare ribbons. The emission in the ribbons is caused by a dense chromosphere and a transition region at high column mass. The ribbons are visible in all chromospheric lines, but least prominent in Ca II 8542 {\AA} line. In some pixels, broad asymmetric profiles with a single emission peak are produced, similar to the profiles observed in flare ribbons. They are caused by a deep onset of the chromospheric temperature rise and large velocity gradients.   The simulation produces long fibrils similar to what is seen in observations. It also produces structures similar to flare ribbons despite the lack of non-thermal electrons in the simulation. The latter suggests that thermal conduction might be a significant agent in transporting flare energy to the chromosphere in addition to non-thermal electrons. ",astrophysics
"  The ultimate detection limit of optical biosensors is often limited by various noise sources, including those introduced by the optical measurement setup. While sophisticated modifications to instrumentation may reduce noise, a simpler approach that can benefit all sensor platforms is the application of signal processing to minimize the deleterious effects of noise. In this work, we show that applying complex Morlet wavelet convolution to Fabry-P\'erot interference fringes characteristic of thin film reflectometric biosensors effectively filters out white noise and low frequency reflectance variations. Subsequent calculation of an average difference in phase between the filtered analyte and reference signals enables a significant reduction in the limit of detection (LOD) enabling closer competition with current state-of-the-art techniques. This method is applied on experimental data sets of thin film porous silicon sensors (PSi) in buffered solution and complex media obtained from two different laboratories. The demonstrated improvement in LOD achieved using wavelet convolution and average phase difference paves the way for PSi optical biosensors to operate with clinically relevant detection limits for medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and food safety.

"  In an asymmetric multislit interference experiment, a quanton is more likely to pass through certain slits than some others. In such a situation one may be able to predict which slit a quanton is more likely to go through, even without using any path-detecting device. This allows one to talk of path predictability. It has been shown earlier that for a two-slit interference, the predictability and fringe visibility are constrained by the inequality $P^2+V^2\le 1$. Generalizing this relation to the case of more than two slits is still an unsolved problem. A new definition for predictability for multi-slit interference is introduced. It is shown that this predictability and quantum coherence follow a duality relation $P^2+C^2\le 1$, which saturates for all pure states. For the case of two slits, this relation reduces to the previously known one. ",quantum physics
"  We study the complexity of holographic superconductors (Einstein-Maxwell-complex scalar actions in $d+1$ dimension) by the `complexity = volume' (CV) conjecture. First, it seems that there is a universal property: the superconducting phase always has a smaller complexity than the unstable normal phase below the critical temperature, which is similar to a free energy. We investigate the temperature dependence of the complexity. In the low temperature limit, the complexity (of formation) scales as $T^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is a function of the complex scalar mass $m^2$, the $U(1)$ charge $q$, and dimension $d$. In particular, for $m^2=0$, we find $\alpha=d-1$, independent of $q$, which can be explained by the near horizon geometry of the low temperature holographic superconductor. Next, we develop a general numerical method to compute the time-dependent complexity by the CV conjecture. By this method, we compute the time-dependent complexity of holographic superconductors. In both normal and superconducting phase, the complexity increases as time goes on and the growth rate saturates to a temperature dependent constant. The higher the temperature is, the bigger the growth rate is. However, the growth rates do not violate the Lloyd's bound in all cases and saturate the Lloyd's bound in the high temperature limit at a late time. ",high energy physics theory
"  We study an $SO(2)\times SO(2)\times SO(2)\times SO(2)$ truncation of four-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to six vector multiplets with $SO(4)\times SO(4)$ gauge group and find a new class of holographic RG flows and supersymmetric Janus solutions. In this truncation, there is a unique $N=4$ supersymmetric $AdS_4$ vacuum dual to an $N=4$ SCFT in three dimensions. In the presence of the axion, the RG flows generally preserve $N=2$ supersymmetry while the supersymmetry is enhanced to $N=4$ for vanishing axion. We find solutions interpolating between the $AdS_4$ vacuum and singular geometries with different residual symmetries. We also show that all the singularities are physically acceptable within the framework of four-dimensional gauged supergravity. Accordingly, the solutions are holographically dual to RG flows from the $N=4$ SCFT to a number of non-conformal phases in the IR. We also find $N=4$ and $N=2$ Janus solutions with $SO(4)\times SO(4)$ and $SO(2)\times SO(2)\times SO(3)\times SO(2)$ symmetries, respectively. The former is obtained from a truncation of all scalars from vector multiplets and can be regarded as a solution of pure $N=4$ gauged supergravity. On the other hand, the latter is a genuine solution of the full matter-coupled theory. These solutions describe conformal interfaces in the $N=4$ SCFT with $N=(4,0)$ and $N=(2,0)$ supersymmetries.

"  String theory predicts that the couplings of Nature descend from dynamical fields. All known string-motivated particle physics models also come with a wide range of possible extra sectors. It is common to posit that such moduli are frozen to a background value, and that extra sectors can be nearly completely decoupled. Performing a partial trace over all sectors other than the visible sector generically puts the visible sector in a mixed state, with coupling constants drawn from a quantum statistical ensemble. An observable consequence of this entanglement between visible and extra sectors is that the reported values of couplings will appear to have an irreducible variance. Including this variance in fits to experimental data gives an important additional parameter that can be used to distinguish this scenario from the case where couplings are treated as fixed parameters. There is a consequent interplay between energy range and precision of an experiment that allows an extended reach for new physics. ",high energy physics theory
"  We analyse global anomalies and related constraints in the Standard Model (SM) and various Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories. We begin by considering four distinct, but equally valid, versions of the SM, in which the gauge group is taken to be $G=G_{\text{SM}}/\Gamma_n$, with $G_{\text{SM}}=SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ and $\Gamma_n$ isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n$ where $n\in\left\{1,2,3,6\right\}$. In addition to deriving constraints on the hypercharges of fields transforming in arbitrary representations of the $SU(3)\times SU(2)$ factor, we study the possibility of global anomalies in theories with these gauge groups by computing the bordism groups $\Omega^{\text{Spin}}_5(BG)$ using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence. In two cases we show that there are no global anomalies beyond the Witten anomaly, while in the other cases we show that there are no global anomalies at all, illustrating the subtle interplay between local and global anomalies. While freedom from global anomalies has been previously shown for the specific fermion content of the SM by embedding the SM in an anomaly-free $SU(5)$ GUT, our results here remain true when the SM fermion content is extended arbitrarily. Going beyond the SM gauge groups, we show that there are no new global anomalies in extensions of the (usual) SM gauge group by $U(1)^m$ for any integer $m$, which correspond to phenomenologically well-motivated BSM theories featuring multiple $Z^\prime$ bosons. Nor do we find any new global anomalies in various grand unified theories, including Pati-Salam and trinification models. We also consider global anomalies in a family of theories with gauge group $SU(N)\times Sp(M)\times U(1)$, which share the phase structure of the SM for certain $(N, M)$. ",high energy physics theory
"  We report our measurements of the bulk radial velocity from a sample of small, metal-rich ejecta knots in Kepler's Supernova Remnant (SNR). We measure the Doppler shift of the He-like Si K$\alpha$ line center energy in the spectra of these knots based on our $Chandra$ High-Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) observation to estimate their radial velocities. We estimate high radial velocities of up to $\sim$ 8,000 km s$^{-1}$ for some of these ejecta knots. We also measure proper motions for our sample based on the archival $Chandra$ Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data taken in 2000, 2006, and 2014. Our measured radial velocities and proper motions indicate that some of these ejecta knots are almost freely-expanding after $\sim$ 400 years since the explosion. The fastest moving knots show proper motions up to $\sim$ 0.2 arcseconds per year. Assuming that these high velocity ejecta knots are traveling ahead of the forward shock of the SNR, we estimate the distance to Kepler's SNR $d$ $\sim$ 4.4 to 7.5 kpc. We find that the ejecta knots in our sample have an average space velocity of $ v_{s} \sim$ 4,600 km s$^{-1}$ (at a distance of 6 kpc). We note that 8 out of the 15 ejecta knots from our sample show a statistically significant (at the 90$\%$ confidence level) redshifted spectrum, compared to only two with a blueshifted spectrum. This may suggest an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution in Kepler's SNR along the line of sight, however a larger sample size is required to confirm this result. ",astrophysics
"  Cosmological models of the early or late universe exhibit (quasi) de Sitter space-times with different stability properties. Considering models derived from string theory, the swampland program does not provide for now a definite characterisation of this stability. In this work we focus on de Sitter solutions of 10d type II supergravities, candidates for classical de Sitter string backgrounds: surprisingly, all known examples are unstable with $\eta_V < -1$. We aim at proving the existence of such a systematic tachyon, and getting formally a bound on the value of $\eta_V$. To that end, we develop three methods, giving us various sufficient conditions for having a tachyon upon assumptions, in analogy with de Sitter no-go theorems. Our analysis eventually indicates the existence of variety of different tachyons, and related bounds on $\eta_V$. We use this knowledge to find 10 new de Sitter solutions of type IIB supergravity, that have tachyons of a different kind, higher $\eta_V$ values and new 6d geometries. One solution even appears to be stable, with however non-compact extra dimensions. ",high energy physics theory
"  One fundamental problem when solving inverse problems is how to find regularization parameters. This article considers solving this problem using data-driven bilevel optimization, i.e. we consider the adaptive learning of the regularization parameter from data by means of optimization. This approach can be interpreted as solving an empirical risk minimization problem, and we analyze its performance in the large data sample size limit for general nonlinear problems. We demonstrate how to implement our framework on linear inverse problems, where we can further show the inverse accuracy does not depend on the ambient space dimension. To reduce the associated computational cost, online numerical schemes are derived using the stochastic gradient descent method. We prove convergence of these numerical schemes under suitable assumptions on the forward problem. Numerical experiments are presented illustrating the theoretical results and demonstrating the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approaches for various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, including Darcy flow, the eikonal equation, and an image denoising example.

"  We provide an analogue of the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition for a class of grafts known as comb-bipartite grafts. The Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition in matching theory is a classical canonical structure theorem for bipartite graphs. The substantial part of this classical theorem resides in bipartite graphs that are factorizable, that is, those with a perfect matching. Minimum joins in grafts, also known as minimum $T$-joins in graphs,   is a generalization of perfect matchings in factorizable graphs. Seb\""o revealed in his paper that comb-bipartite grafts form one of the two fundamental classes of grafts that serve as skeletons or building blocks of any grafts. Particularly, any bipartite grafts, that is, bipartite counterpart of grafts, can be considered as a recursive combination of comb-bipartite grafts. In this paper, we generalize the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition for comb-bipartite grafts.

"  In this work, we analyze the role of AGN feedback in quenching star formation for massive, central galaxies in the local Universe. In particular, we compare the prediction of two semi-analytic models (L-GALAXIES and SAGE) featuring different schemes for AGN feedback, with the SDSS DR7 taking advantage of a novel technique for identifying central galaxies in an observational dataset. This enables us to study the correlation between the model passive fractions, which is predicted to be suppressed by feedback from an AGN, and the observed passive fractions in an observationally motivated parameter space. While the passive fractions for observed central galaxies show a good correlation with stellar mass and bulge mass, passive fractions in L-GALAXIES correlate with the halo and black hole mass. For SAGE, the passive fraction correlate with the bulge mass as well. Among the two models, SAGE has a smaller scatter in the black hole - bulge mass (M_BH - M_Bulge) relation and a slope that agrees better with the most recent observations at z \sim 0. Despite the more realistic prescription of radio mode feedback in SAGE, there are still tensions left with the observed passive fractions and the distribution of quenched galaxies. These tensions may be due to the treatment of galaxies living in non-resolved substructures and the resulting higher merger rates that could bring cold gas which is available for star formation.

For the requirements of the motors in the NASA N3-X concept aircraft, we find that fully superconducting machines could achieve 3.5 times higher power-to-weight ratio than partially superconducting machines. Furthermore, our model can be used to calculate the relevant KPIs such as mass, efficiency and cryogenic cooling requirements for any other machine design. ",physics

"  The regulation of temperature at the macro and microscale is a major energy-consuming process of humankind. Modern cooling systems account for 15% of the global energy consumption and are responsible for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Due to global warming, a ten-fold growth in the demand of cooling technologies is expected in the next 30 years, thus linking global warming and cooling needs through a worrying negative feedback loop. Here, we propose an inexpensive solution to this global challenge based on a single-layer of silica microspheres self-assembled on a soda-lime glass substrate. This two-dimensional (2D) crystal acts as a visibly translucent thermal blackbody for above-ambient daytime radiative cooling and can be used to passively improve the thermal performance of devices that undergo critical heating during operation. The temperature of a crystalline silicon wafer was found to be 14K lower during daytime when covered with our thermal emitter, reaching an average temperature difference of 19K when the structure was backed with a silver layer. In comparison, the soda-lime glass used as a reference in our measurements lowered the temperature of the silicon wafer by just 5 K. The cooling power density of this rather simple radiative cooler under direct sunlight was found to be up to 350 W/m2 when applied to hot surfaces with relative temperatures of 50 K above the ambient. This is crucial to radiatively cool down electronic devices, such as solar cells, where an increase in temperature has drastic effects on performance. Our 2D thermo-functional material includes a single layer of spheres emitting long-wave radiation through the infrared atmospheric window and over a broad wavelength ange, thus providing effective radiative cooling using the outer space as a heat sink at 3 K.

"  By using the general framework of affine Gaudin models, we construct a new class of integrable sigma models. They are defined on a coset of the direct product of $N$ copies of a Lie group over some diagonal subgroup and they depend on $3N-2$ free parameters. For $N=1$ the corresponding model coincides with the well-known symmetric space sigma model. Starting from the Hamiltonian formulation, we derive the Lagrangian for the $N=2$ case and show that it admits a remarkably simple form in terms of the classical $\mathcal{R}$-matrix underlying the integrability of these models. We conjecture that a similar form of the Lagrangian holds for arbitrary $N$. Specifying our general construction to the case of $SU(2)$ and $N=2$, and eliminating one of the parameters, we find a new three-parametric integrable model with the manifold $T^{1,1}$ as its target space. We further comment on the connection of our results with those existing in the literature. ",high energy physics theory
"  We reconsider the tensionless limit on bosonic closed string theory, where the 3d Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) algebra appears as symmetries on the worldsheet, as opposed to two copies of the Virasoro algebra in the case of the usual tensile theory. This is an ultra-relativistic limit on the worldsheet. We consider the induced representations of the BMS algebra in the oscillator basis and show that the limit takes the tensile closed string vacuum to the ""induced"" vacuum which is identified as a Neumann boundary state. Hence, rather remarkably, an open string emerges from closed strings in the tensionless limit. We also follow the perturbative states in the tensile theory in the limit and show that there is a Bose-Einstein like condensation of all perturbative states on this induced vacuum. This ties up nicely with the picture of the formation of a long string from a gas of strings in the Hagedorn temperature, where the effective string tension goes to zero. ",high energy physics theory
"  We revisit the symmetries of massless two-dimensional adjoint QCD with gauge group $SU(N)$. The dynamics is not sufficiently constrained by the ordinary symmetries and anomalies. Here we show that the theory in fact admits $\sim 2^{2N}$ non-invertible symmetries which severely constrain the possible infrared phases and massive excitations. We prove that for all $N$ these new symmetries enforce deconfinement of the fundamental quark. When the adjoint quark has a small mass, $m\ll g_\mathrm{YM}$, the theory confines and the non-invertible symmetries are softly broken. We use them to compute analytically the $k$-string tension for $N\leq 5$. Our results suggest that the $k$-string tension, $T_k$, is $T_k\sim |m| \sin(\pi k /N)$ for all $N$. We also consider the dynamics of adjoint QCD deformed by symmetric quartic fermion interactions. These operators are not generated by the RG flow due to the non-invertible symmetries, thus violating the ordinary notion of naturalness. We conjecture partial confinement for the deformed theory by these four-fermion interactions, and prove it for $SU(N\leq5)$ gauge theory. Comparing the topological phases at zero and large mass, we find that a massless particle ought to appear on the string for some intermediate nonzero mass, consistent with an emergent supersymmetry at nonzero mass. We also study the possible infrared phases of adjoint QCD allowed by the non-invertible symmetries, which we are able to do exhaustively for small values of $N$.

Regarding their electrical transport properties, the produced thin films show semiconducting-like behavior, regardless the Sr doping level, which is most likely due to both the oxygen deficiencies and the grainy nature of the films. Furthermore, room temperature current-voltage (I-V) measurements reveal stable resistance switching behavior, which is well explained in terms of space-charge limited conduction mechanism.

The loss function used for backpropagation depends on the generated pattern layouts, their efficiencies, and efficiency gradients, which are calculated by the adjoint variables method using forward and adjoint electromagnetic simulations. We observe that the distribution of devices generated by the network continuously shifts towards high performance design space regions over the course of optimization. Upon training completion, the best generated devices have efficiencies comparable to or exceeding the best devices designed using standard topology optimization. Our proposed global optimization algorithm can generally apply to other gradient-based optimization problems in optics, mechanics and electronics. ",physics
"  Building upon recent developments of force-based estimators with a reduced variance for the computation of densities, radial distribution functions or local transport properties from molecular simulations, we show that the variance can be further reduced by considering optimal linear combinations of such estimators. This control variates approach, well known in Statistics and already used in other branches of computational Physics, has been comparatively much less exploited in molecular simulations. We illustrate this idea on the radial distribution function and the one-dimensional density of a bulk and confined Lennard-Jones fluid, where the optimal combination of estimators is determined for each distance or position, respectively. In addition to reducing the variance everywhere at virtually no additional cost, this approach cures an artefact of the initial force-based estimators, namely small but non-zero values of the quantities in regions where they should vanish. Beyond the examples considered here, the present work highlights more generally the underexplored potential of control variates to estimate observables from molecular simulations. ",physics
"  The performance of many control tasks with Rydberg atoms can be improved via suppression of the motion-induced dephasing between ground and Rydberg states of neutral atoms. The dephasing often occurs during the {\it gap} time when the atom is shelved in a Rydberg state before its deexcitation. By using laser fields to induce specific extra phase change to the Rydberg state during the gap time, it is possible to faithfully transfer the Rydberg state back to the ground state after the gap. Although the Rydberg state transitions back and forth between different eigenstates during the gap time, it preserves the blockade interaction between the atom of interest and a nearby Rydberg excitation. This simple method of suppressing the motional dephasing of a flying Rydberg atom can be used in a broad range of quantum control over neutral atoms. ",quantum physics
"  Observations of ammonia in interstellar environments have revealed high levels of deuteration, and all its D-containing variants, including ND$_3$, have been detected in cold prestellar cores and around young protostars. The observation of these deuterated isotopologues is very useful to elucidate the chemical and physical processes taking place during the very early stages of star formation, as the abundance of deuterated molecules is highly enhanced in dense and cold gas. Nitrogen hydride radicals are key species lying at the very beginning of the reaction pathway leading to the formation of NH$_3$ and organic molecules of pre-biotic interest, but relatively little information is known about their D-bearing isotopologues. To date, only ND has been detected in the interstellar gas.

A thermodynamic volume associated to the non-trivial topology of the spacetime plays an important role in this construction. We then consider these solitons within the holographic ``complexity equals action'' and ``complexity equals volume'' conjectures as simple examples of spacetimes with nontrivial rotation and topology. We find distinct behaviours for the volume and action, with the counterterm for null boundaries playing a significant role in the latter case. For large solitons we find that both proposals yield a complexity of formation proportional to a power of the thermodynamic volume, $V^{3/4}$. In fact, up to numerical prefactors, the result coincides with the analogous one for large black holes. ",high energy physics theory

  The gaussoid axioms are conditional independence inference rules which characterize regular Gaussian CI structures over a three-element ground set. It is known that no finite set of inference rules completely describes regular Gaussian CI as the ground set grows. In this article we show that the gaussoid axioms logically imply every inference rule of at most two antecedents which is valid for regular Gaussians over any ground set. The proof is accomplished by exhibiting for each inclusion-minimal gaussoid extension of at most two CI statements a regular Gaussian realization. Moreover we prove that all those gaussoids have rational positive-definite realizations inside every $\varepsilon$-ball around the identity matrix. For the proof we introduce the concept of algebraic Gaussians over arbitrary fields and of positive Gaussians over ordered fields and obtain the same two-antecedental completeness of the gaussoid axioms for algebraic and positive Gaussians over all fields of characteristic zero as a byproduct. ,mathematics

"  Millimeter-wave (30-300 GHz) and Terahertz-band communications (0.3-10 THz) are envisioned as key wireless technologies to satisfy the demand for Terabit-per-second (Tbps) links in the 5G and beyond eras. The very large available bandwidth in this ultra-broadband frequency range comes at the cost of a very high propagation loss, which combined with the low power of mm-wave and THz-band transceivers limits the communication distance and data-rates. In this paper, the concept of intelligent communication environments enabled by Ultra-Massive MIMO platforms is proposed to increase the communication distance and data-rates at mm-wave and THz-band frequencies. An end-to-end physical model is developed by taking into account the capabilities of novel intelligent plasmonic antenna arrays which can operate in transmission, reception, reflection and waveguiding, as well as the peculiarities of the mm-wave and THz-band multi-path channel. Based on the developed model, extensive quantitative results for different scenarios are provided to illustrate the performance improvements in terms of both achievable distance and data-rate in Ultra-Massive MIMO environments.

"  Let $f(z)\in 1 + z\mathbb{Q}[[z]]$ and $\mathcal{S}$ be an infinite set of prime numbers such that, for all $p\in\mathcal{S}$, we can reduce $f(z)$ modulo $p$. When $f(z)$ is D-finite, we usually get that $f(z)_{\mid p}$ is algebraic over $\mathbb{F}_p(z)$. If in addition $f(z)_{\mid p}$ cancels a polynomial of the form $X-A_p(z)X^{p^l}$, we can use these equations to obtain results of transcendence and algebraic independence over $\mathbb{Q}(z)$. In this article, we look for conditions on the differential operators canceling $f(z)$ which guarantee the existence of these particular equations. Suppose that $f(z)$ cancels a differential operator $\mathcal{H}\in\mathbb{Q}(z)[d/dz]$ endowed with a strong Frobenius structure for all $p\in\mathcal{S}$ as well as a Fuchsian differential operator $\mathcal{D}\in\mathbb{Q}(z)[d/dz]$ such that zero is a regular singular point of $\mathcal{D}$ and the zero exponents of $\mathcal{D}$ are all zero.

For that we rewrite the functions that define the amplitudes in terms of oscillatory functions and we use the Taylor expansion of these functions for arriving at the final form of the momenta integrals. The total probability is analysed in terms of the ratio between the mass of the fermion and expansion parameter and we recover the Minkowski limit when the expansion parameter is vanishing. Finally it is proven that from our results we can compute the number of fermions in terms of expansion parameter. ,high energy physics theory

"  This paper addresses the design and analysis of feedback-based online algorithms to control systems or networked systems based on performance objectives and engineering constraints that may evolve over time. The emerging time-varying convex optimization formalism is leveraged to model optimal operational trajectories of the systems, as well as explicit local and network-level operational constraints. Departing from existing batch and feed-forward optimization approaches, the design of the algorithms capitalizes on an online implementation of primal-dual projected-gradient methods; the gradient steps are, however, suitably modified to accommodate feedback from the system in the form of measurements - hence, the term ""online optimization with feedback."" By virtue of this approach, the resultant algorithms can cope with model mismatches in the algebraic representation of the system states and outputs, they avoid pervasive measurements of exogenous inputs, and they naturally lend themselves to a distributed implementation. Under suitable assumptions, analytical convergence claims are established in terms of dynamic regret. Furthermore, when the synthesis of the feedback-based online algorithms is based on a regularized Lagrangian function, Q-linear convergence to solutions of the time-varying optimization problem is shown.

"  Quantum theory describes multipartite objects of various types: quantum states, nonlocal boxes, steering assemblages, teleportages, distributed measurements, channels, and so on. Such objects describe, for example, the resources shared in quantum networks. Not all such objects are useful, however. In the context of space-like separated parties, devices which can be simulated using local operations and shared randomness are useless, and it is of paramount importance to be able to practically distinguish useful from useless quantum resources. Accordingly, a body of literature has arisen to provide tools for witnessing and quantifying the nonclassicality of objects of each specific type. In the present work, we provide a framework which subsumes and generalizes all of these resources, as well as the tools for witnessing and quantifying their nonclassicality. ",quantum physics
"  Recently, the source separation performance was greatly improved by time-domain audio source separation based on dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN). DPRNN is a simple but effective model for a long sequential data. While DPRNN is quite efficient in modeling a sequential data of the length of an utterance, i.e., about 5 to 10 second data, it is harder to apply it to longer sequences such as whole conversations consisting of multiple utterances. It is simply because, in such a case, the number of time steps consumed by its internal module called inter-chunk RNN becomes extremely large. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a multi-path RNN (MPRNN), a generalized version of DPRNN, that models the input data in a hierarchical manner. In the MPRNN framework, the input data is represented at several (>3) time-resolutions, each of which is modeled by a specific RNN sub-module. For example, the RNN sub-module that deals with the finest resolution may model temporal relationship only within a phoneme, while the RNN sub-module handling the most coarse resolution may capture only the relationship between utterances such as speaker information. We perform experiments using simulated dialogue-like mixtures and show that MPRNN has greater model capacity, and it outperforms the current state-of-the-art DPRNN framework especially in online processing scenarios.

"  The relativistic charged spinor matter field is quantized in the background of a straight cosmic string with nonvanishing transverse size. The most general boundary conditions ensuring the impossibility for matter to penetrate through the edge of the string core are considered. The role of discrete symmetries is elucidated, and analytic expressions for the temporal and spatial components of the induced vacuum current are derived in the case of either P or CT invariant boundary condition with two parameters varying arbitrarily from point to point of the edge. The requirement of physical plausibility for the global induced vacuum characteristics is shown to remove completely an arbitrariness in boundary conditions. We find out that a magnetic field is induced in the vacuum and that a sheath in the form of a tube of the magnetic flux lines encloses a cosmic string. The dependence of the induced vacuum magnetic field strength on the string flux and tension, as well as on the transverse size of the string and on the distance from the string, is unambiguously determined.

We prove that the laws governing the dynamics of a black hole horizon, the null Raychaudhuri and Damour equations, are Carrollian conservation laws obtained by taking the ultra-relativistic limit of the conservation of an energy-momentum tensor; we also discuss their physical interpretation. We show that the vector fields preserving the Carrollian geometry of the horizon, dubbed Carrollian Killing vectors, include BMS-like supertranslations and superrotations and that they have non-trivial associated conserved charges on the horizon. In particular, we build a generalization of the angular momentum to the case of non-stationary black holes. Finally, we discuss the relation of these conserved quantities to the infinite tower of charges of the covariant phase space formalism. ",high energy physics theory
"  Thanks to their quick placement and high flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be very useful in the current and future wireless communication systems. With a growing number of smart devices and infrastructure-free communication networks, it is necessary to legitimately monitor these networks to prevent crimes. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to exploit the flexibility of the UAV for legitimate monitoring via joint trajectory design and energy management. The system includes a suspicious transmission link with a terrestrial transmitter and a terrestrial receiver, and a UAV to monitor the suspicious link. The UAV can adjust its positions and send jamming signal to the suspicious receiver to ensure successful eavesdropping. Based on this model, we first develop an approach to minimize the overall jamming energy consumption of the UAV. Building on a judicious (re-)formulation, an alternating optimization approach is developed to compute a locally optimal solution in polynomial time. Furthermore, we model and include the propulsion power to minimize the overall energy consumption of the UAV. Leveraging the successive convex approximation method, an effective iterative approach is developed to find a feasible solution fulfilling the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

The fitting results show that current data set favors a high-rigidity break at $\sim 325 \mathrm{GV}$ in diffusion coefficient rather than a break at $\sim 365 \mathrm{GV}$ in primary source injections. Meanwhile, the fitted values of the factors to rescale the cosmic-ray (CR) flux of secondary species/components after propagation show us that the secondary flux are underestimated in current propagation model. It implies that we might locate in a slow diffusion zone, in which the CRs propagate with a small value of diffusion coefficient compared with the averaged value in the galaxy. Another hint from the fitting results show that extra secondary CR nuclei injection may be needed in current data set. All these new hints should be paid more attention in future research.

"  Radial velocity (RV) searches for Earth-mass exoplanets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars are limited by the effects of stellar variability on the host star. In particular, suppression of convective blueshift and brightness inhomogeneities due to photospheric faculae/plage and starspots are the dominant contribution to the variability of such stellar RVs. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a powerful tool for modeling these quasi-periodic variations. We investigate the limits of this technique using 800 days of RVs from the solar telescope on the HARPS-N spectrograph. These data provide a well-sampled time series of stellar RV variations. Into this data set, we inject Keplerian signals with periods between 100 and 500 days and amplitudes between 0.6 and 2.4 m s$^{-1}$. We use GP regression to fit the resulting RVs and determine the statistical significance of recovered periods and amplitudes. We then generate synthetic RVs with the same covariance properties as the solar data to determine a lower bound on the observational baseline necessary to detect low-mass planets in Venus-like orbits around a Sun-like star. Our simulations show that discovering such planets using current-generation spectrographs using GP regression will require more than 12 years of densely sampled RV observations. Furthermore, even with a perfect model of stellar variability, discovering a true exo-Venus with current instruments would take over 15 years. Therefore, next-generation spectrographs and better models of stellar variability are required for detection of such planets. ",astrophysics
"  Sixth generation (6G) mobile networks may include new passive technologies, such as ambient backscatter communication or the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, to avoid the emission of waves and the corresponding energy consumption. On the one hand, a reconfigurable intelligent surface improves the network performance by adding electronically controlled reflected paths in the radio propagation channel. On the other hand, in an ambient backscatter system, a device, named tag, communicates towards a reader by backscattering the waves of an ambient source (such as a TV tower). However, the tag's backscattered signal is weak and strongly interfered by the direct signal from the ambient source. In this paper, we propose a new reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted ambient backscatter system. The proposed surface allows to control the reflection of an incident wave coming from the exact source location towards the tag and reader locations (creating hot spots at their locations), thanks to passive reflected beams from a predefined codebook. A common phase-shift can also be applied to the beam. Thanks to these features, we demonstrate experimentally that the performance of ambient backscatter communications can be significantly improved.

"  We present a difference analogue of a result given by Hrushovski on differential Galois groups under specialization. Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $\mathbb{X}$ an irreducible affine algebraic variety over $k$.

Assume that the Galois group $G$ of the above equation over $\overline{k(\mathbb{X})}(x)$ is defined over $k(\mathbb{X})$ i.e. the vanishing ideal of $G$ is generated by a finite set $S\subset k(\mathbb{X})[X,1/\det(X)]$. For a ${\bf c}\in \mathbb{X}$, denote by $v_{\bf c}$ the map from $k[\mathbb{X}]$ to $k$ given by $v_{\bf c}(f)=f({\bf c})$ for any $f\in k[\mathbb{X}]$.

"  Accurate multi-class segmentation is a long-standing challenge in medical imaging, especially in scenarios where classes share strong similarity. Segmenting retinal blood vessels in retinal photographs is one such scenario, in which arteries and veins need to be identified and differentiated from each other and from the background. Intra-segment misclassification, i.e. veins classified as arteries or vice versa, frequently occurs when arteries and veins intersect, whereas in binary retinal vessel segmentation, error rates are much lower. We thus propose a new approach that decomposes multi-class segmentation into multiple binary, followed by a binary-to-multi-class fusion network. The network merges representations of artery, vein, and multi-class feature maps, each of which are supervised by expert vessel annotation in adversarial training.

"  Recently, interest on the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has aroused. Specifically, UAVs can be used in cellular networks as aerial users for delivery, surveillance, rescue search, or as an aerial base station (aBS) for communication with ground users in remote uncovered areas or in dense environments requiring prompt high capacity.

As in our previous studies, the large and chemically diverse GMTKN55 benchmark suite was used for evaluation. Especially when using the D4 rather than D3BJ dispersion model, xDSD has a slight performance advantage in WTMAD2. As found previously, PBEP86 is the winning combination for the semilocal parts. xDSDn-PBEP86-D4 marginally outperforms the previous 'best in class' $\omega$B97M(2) Berkeley double hybrid, but without range separation and using fewer than half the number of empirical parameters. Range separation turns out to offer only marginal further improvements on GMTKN55 itself. While $\omega$B97M(2) still yields better performance for small-molecule thermochemistry, this is outweighed in WTMAD2 by superior performance of the new functionals for conformer equilibria. Results for two external test sets with pronounced static correlation effects may indicate that range-separated double hybrids are more resilient to such effects. ",physics

"  What is the dimension of spacetime? We address this question in the context of the AdS/CFT Correspondence. We give a prescription for computing the number of large bulk dimensions, $D$, from strongly-coupled CFT$_d$ data, where ""large"" means parametrically of order the AdS scale. The idea is that unitarity of 1-loop AdS amplitudes, dual to non-planar CFT correlators, fixes $D$ in terms of tree-level data. We make this observation rigorous by deriving a positive-definite sum rule for the 1-loop double-discontinuity in the flat space/bulk-point limit. This enables us to prove an array of AdS/CFT folklore, and to infer new properties of large $N$ CFTs at strong coupling that ensure consistency of emergent large extra dimensions with string/M-theory. We discover an OPE universality at the string scale: to leading order in large $N$, heavy-heavy-light three-point functions, with heavy operators that are parametrically lighter than a power of $N$, are linear in the heavy conformal dimension. We explore its consequences for supersymmetric CFTs and explain how emergent large extra dimensions relate to a Sublattice Weak Gravity Conjecture for CFTs. Lastly, we conjecture, building on a claim of arXiv:0908.0756, that any CFT with large higher-spin gap and no global symmetries has a holographic hierarchy: $D=d+1$ ",high energy physics theory
"  We show that the effects of decoherence on quantum steering ellipsoids can be controlled by a specific reservoir manipulating, in both Markovian and non-Markovian realms. Therefore, the so-called maximal steered coherence could be protected through reservoir engineering implemented by coupling auxiliary qubits to the reservoir. ",quantum physics

"  We discuss various aspects of anisotropic gravity in $(d+D)$-dimensional spacetime where $D$-dimensions are treated as extra dimensions. It is based on a foliation preserving diffeomorphism(FPD) invariance and an anisotropic conformal invariance. The anisotropy is embodied by introducing a factor $z$ which characterizes the scaling degree of the extra $D$-dimensions against the $d$-dimensional base spacetime. There is no intrinsic scale in our model but a physical scale $M_*$ emerges as a consequence of spontaneous conformal symmetry breaking of Weyl scalar field which mediates the anisotropic scaling symmetry. Some vacuum solutions are obtained and we discuss an issue of `size separation' between the base spacetime and the extra dimensions. The size separation means large hierarchy between the scales appearing in the base spacetime and the extra dimensions respectively. We also discuss interesting theories obtained from our model. In a $(d,D)=(2,2)$ case, we suggest a UV-complete quantum gravity which might become Einstein-Hilbert theory in IR. In the case of (4,1), we propose a resolution of hierarchy problem and discuss comparison with brane-world model's results. In a certain (2,1) case, we obtain CGHS-model. ",high energy physics theory
"  There is compelling evidence for a highly energetic Seyfert explosion (10^{56-57} erg) that occurred in the Galactic Centre a few million years ago. The clearest indications are the x-ray/gamma-ray ""10 kpc bubbles"" identified by the Rosat and Fermi satellites. In an earlier paper, we suggested another manifestation of this nuclear activity, i.e. elevated H-alpha emission along a section of the Magellanic Stream due to a burst (or flare) of ionizing radiation from Sgr A*. We now provide further evidence for a powerful flare event: UV absorption line ratios (in particular CIV/CII, SiIV/SiII) observed by the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that some Stream clouds towards both galactic poles are highly ionized by a source capable of producing ionization energies up to at least 50 eV. We show how these are clouds caught in a beam of bipolar, radiative ""ionization cones"" from a Seyfert nucleus associated with Sgr A*. In our model, the biconic axis is tilted by about 15 deg from the South Galactic Pole with an opening angle of roughly 60 deg. For the Stream at such large Galactic distances (D > 75 kpc), nuclear activity is a plausible explanation for all of the observed signatures: elevated H-alpha emission and H ionization fraction (X_e > 0.5), enhanced CIV/CII and SiIV/SiII ratios, and high CIV and SiIV column densities. Wind-driven ""shock cones"" are ruled out because the Fermi bubbles lose their momentum and energy to the Galactic corona long before reaching the Stream. The nuclear flare event must have had a radiative UV luminosity close to the Eddington limit (f_E ~ 0.1-1). Our time-dependent Seyfert flare models adequately explain the observations and indicate the Seyfert flare event took place T_o = 3.5 +/- 1 Myr ago. The timing estimates are consistent with the mechanical timescales needed to explain the x-ray/gamma-ray bubbles in leptonic jet/wind models (2-8 Myr). ",astrophysics
"  I use a mean-field approximation to show the rapid collapse of heteropolymers from random walk size to a much smaller, molten globule state due to hydrophobic interactions, to be followed by a slower annealing process in which there is little change in overall size. ",physics
